IndiGo, being a low-cost no-frills airline is a value for money indeed. Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance. I also prefer this airlines as they are the most punctual airlines.

They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane? Lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad. And it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I explained that at Singapore it is possible to freely transfer between terminals T2 & T3 without needing to pass Immigration. They refused to agree and insisted we required a Singapore visa. After much discussion they allowed us to board after they realized we possessed valid US & other visas. Wereached Singapore and there is no requirement to pass Immigration.

As always exemplary cabin service, efficient check in service. This time had a harrowing experience that the airline handled with aplomb: I checked in and was asked if I had a PowerPac in my luggage and I said no. While waiting at the departure gate to board, the IndiGo agent called me over and said that there was a problem with my check-in luggage and that there was something ""suspicious"" inside. They asked me to exit security (surrendering my passport at Immigration and having my boarding pass cancelled). An IndiGo employee accompanied me to the bowels of the airport where my luggage had been held. I opened it up and what had aroused the scanner operator's suspicions was a litre of oil I was carrying. They opened the container examined it declared it ""passed"" and I re-locked my luggage. All this time I was very nervous that I might miss my flight. The IndiGo employee who accompanied me throughout this ordeal assured me that I would not. He re-escorted me through security and immigration where a new boarding pass awaited me. He assuaged my nervousness, stayed with me till I went through security and Immigration again, escorted me to the plane where I was the last passenger to board! A exemplary and totally extraordinary performance by an IndiGo employee who stayed with me during the entire ordeal. Many many thanks. On the downside, no Foreigner Arrival Cards on board the flight from BKK to Cal and no Thai immigration forms on the flight from Cal to BKK.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

The check-in process was smooth and the baggage handling went well. I later found out as I had a ""Lite"" ticket, which was cheaper, I had to pay extra for my checked baggage. I did that. A bus took us to our aircraft. The plane was loaded and it took off exactly on time. The seats were a bit tight and legroom wasn't that good so I was a bit uncomfortable for a 2hr long flight. The head-rest of the seat also wasn't that comfortable. But you know, you can't expect that much in economy and the aircraft was also of a narrow-body type. With Indigo, you have to pay for food if you are flying economy, I ordered coffee and a Tandoori chicken Sandwich. From my judgement, the cost was a bit much for food of that quality. The sandwich was cold. You even have to call flight attendants for water every time, which in my opinion, would be much simpler if they just gave you a bottle. The plane's air-conditioning had troubles, so it was a bit hot. At last, the plane landed on New Delhi after 2hr 5min.

The flight was a pretty short one, one hour. During that time, these are the things that I felt about the airline. 1) Check In: The Lines were long, the number of counters were pretty reasonable but could be increased considering the number of flights IndiGo operates. My advice, arrive early. 2) Aircraft: Neat. Clean aircraft. No problems. 3) Crew service: Pretty good. Up to standards. 4) Ground Support: I didn't face any trouble and the staff were pretty helpful too. 5) On Board Meal: it's not complementary. You have to buy it. Tasted good for the money. 6) Punctuality: On-time. No issues there. 7) Communications: Book online. You would get all the information via SMS, even the boarding gate information.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We had booked our flight 3 months ago. Our flight was from Trivandrum to Patna via Bengaluru. While we wer in Thiruvananthapuram we got a phone call from IndiGo 2 days prior to our departure saying that one my flights has been canceled and other one rescheduled. I was suppose to leave Trivandrum at 8:00 am and reach Patna by 3:00pm afternoon and we had to travel all the way to Nepal in order to attend a meeting on the very next day. IndiGo screwed us very bad and said they will provide us with a different flight but both on separate days. Now I am here in Trivandrum airport one day earlier to my actual departure and waiting for my flight which has been delayed once again. Now I will reach Bengaluru at midnight where I have to stay for 12 hours waiting for my next flight. Now my time and money are completely wasted. Staying over night in Bengaluru costs minimum ₹5000 and on top I'm stuck here wasting my time when I had to attend a party.

We proceeded to security where the staff was friendly and gave clear directions to passengers who did not know the rules yet. After security however things got exciting again, while presenting our boarding pass I heard the staff talk to each other and we were told there was something in our bag that caught their attention. All was said in an extremely friendly manner while we racked our brains trying to imagine what was in the suitcase. I was allowed down to the tarmac where I opened the suitcase and it was examined, it turned out to be a door stop I brought?

But at the time of check in, the officer denied & started asking me the name of person who confirmed. Now, who remembers the name of customer care executive! So, I had to take the luggage in Mumbai & check-in again. With no other option, I did take the luggage. The gap between the 2 flight was of about 3 hours. I was supposed to be transferred to International airport. When I asked the ground staff to arrange transfer, they were clueless & asked me to go out, hire a taxi & leave. I got upset, but instead of helping me, the Mumbai ground staff kept on arguing. The taxi took a good time to reach International airport, as it was peak hour. Finally we could make it just in time only to find that the flight was delayed. This is the first time I have seen that international flight booked under one PNR from an airline website.

IndiGo definitely lived up-to it's tagline of on-time budget airline. Would definitely love to fly it again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Travel was good, the flight crew were good too. The flight was on time. However there a strange high pitched sound just before take off which lasted for 5-10 minutes and the AC stopped working until the flight took off. The sound was again heard during landing too. The baggage at conveyer belt after the flight landed was messed up. On the same belt there was back to back baggage for 3 flights which was cumbersome and troublesome. I had to stand at the belt for an hour waiting to receive my luggage, it was very crowded with people looking for bags.

Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Anybody who has been through immigration at Suvarnbhumi expects a wait of up to one hour. So, to not have immigration forms on board a flight can develop into an even longer wait. Come on, IndiGo!

Flew Bangkok to Pune via Kolkata with IndiGo. On time, both departures and both arrivals. Smooth boarding from Bangkok. Impeccable onboard service und attitude. Chaotic boarding at Kolkata: a long queue formed at boarding. Fine. Then an announcement was made by a ground staff member, in a voice that could barely be heard that rows 16-30 would board first. Since the announcement was barely audible, people waiting in the queue were confused, thus standing in line, not knowing what to do. Ground crew member - only one IndiGo staff manning their pre-boarding desk/area - did not repeat announcement and just stood by looking around and not allowing anyone to board. People waiting. In the meantime some passengers not in the queue approached this confused ground staff person, spoke to him and were allowed to board. No idea if these people were going to occupy rows 16-30. Nothing happening; line not moving; IndiGo staff still looking as if he was in a daze. No repeat announcement, in an audible voice, re rows 16-30. Since I was in line, had a seat in row 21, I broke the queue, presented my boarding pass, and passed security. Don't know what happened after that. IndiGo needs to get its act together in this area.

It was also a morning flight but they had none of the breakfast options available - Ramen noodles were my best option. Return flight had a great crew but the Delhi airport check in was a nightmare.

I have flown every low cost airline in India and I find Indigo the best. Their booking is hassle free through app on both ios and android. Web check-in is a breeze, getting any optional services is also good. The check-in is curteous and to the point. Mind you they dont allow even 1kg extra on planes without payment, plus they have also started to screen weight of cabin bag just before boarding the flight. Its a business model because they are a budget airline. The planes are clean with courteous crew. The leg space of economy seats is ample. I am a heavy built person and I have never faced space crunch in the seats. The in-flight food is okay, nothing to write about. I never had to wait for my baggage for more than 10 min.

Something I have written about in the past, the fact that the on board crew never has any Arrival Forms for foreigners, was finally rectified but, however, with an amusing twist: on my asking the cabin attendant for an Arrival Form, something that only non-Indian nationals need to fill, she very pertly asked me as to why I needed one since I look Indian. I replied that I was only 99.99% Indian, the remaining .01% being American as I carry that country's passport. (I did not mention that the Indian diaspora is the largest in the world. I was, however, tempted to do so.) P.S Food and beverages have to be purchased on IndiGo. I never comment on these as I usually carry aboard lots of munchies/snackies.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good.

The former arrived at the carousel; the latter did not. Enquired from IndiGo staff attending at and they informed me that since the tube was marked 'fragile' it would arrive separately very shortly (which it did) and asked me if I was connecting to an IndiGo flight and on my answering, yes, I was, IndiGo said they will assign staff member to escort me and my luggage to domestic departures. A lady took charge of me and my luggage - she insisted on pushing my trolley, I insisted on doing it myself; I won - and took me all the way to IndiGo x-ray security. As I was carrying a bottle of duty-fee liquor in my carry on, and since liquor cannot be carried on domestic flights, I checked my back pack through x-ray and the IndiGo staff, to avoid bottle smashing, tied my backpack up very securely and put a fragile tag on it and asked the staff escorting me to inform IndiGo check in counter, where the pack was specially tagged and given to a baggage handler to carry it personally into the baggage room.

Arrived at check in three hours early and had no checked in baggage so check in was smooth and quick. Boarding was also very quick and professional. Upon boarding I changed my seat from where I was sitting in the front to the seats just in front of the emergency seats near the wing as it was empty. I believe Indigo keeps these seats reserved as you can pay on board to upgrade these seats but no one bothered me for moving to these seats. Slept throughout the flight and overall flight was comfortable and very clean. No IFE or food but this was a short flight so not bothered at all about it would recommend in future.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

But when I was boarding the aircraft, I was amazed to find that loads of passengers had huge hand bags and in some cases multiple bags, which possibly were more than the weight limit. The ground staff told me that they check the weight again at the boarding gate to ensure that there is no overweight baggage, but I did not see any other bag being weighed other than mine!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The journey was very comfortable, aircraft relatively new, flight stewardess were very friendly. Flight departure/arrival were on time. During the hop at Kolkata, we were even allowed to visit the cockpit and the captain demonstrated the functionalities.

I checked other airlines before I booked and IndiGo were consistently cheaper, often by a wide margin. Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out. But these are minor quibbles, I would have no hesitation choosing IndiGo next time.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Finally they herded us in a bus that was then parked in front of the plane on the tarmac for 20 minutes while the incoming passengers disembarked. Needless to say we were packed like sardines and it was extremely hot. Also there was no step - senior citizens like myself cannot climb easily. I have reported this before but it has made no difference. At Lucknow despite there being aerobridges we had to get down in the sun at 2:30 pm and were again herded into a bus. I was reluctant to board as the bus was very full but was forced to climb in. Is it a problem to use the bus a second time or the aerobridge or maybe nobody cares? It was the same story on the way back on the 22nd of May for the 6.40 flight. We were again stuffed into two buses and had to risk falling on somebody's luggage because the insensitive staff did not care. I will not travel on Indigo again unless they provide a step on the buses and do not herd us in like cattle.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

December 2014. Worst possible time of the year to fly out of Delhi. Had horrible experiences due to the fog. The outgoing flight was 4hrs late. You might think we were made to wait at the airport for this time but no we were boarded onto the aircraft bang on time and were made to wait there for over 4 hrs. That being said I agree this is no fault of the airline as the airport authorities force them to board the planes to decongest the terminal. Complimentary snack box and tea/coffee was provided. On the return flight( night time flight) we were diverted to Ahmedabad due to fog. This was totally acceptable but the events which followed made me doubt Indigo's reputation. We were not allocated a hotel for the next 5hrs. When we approached the assistants at Ahmedabad they kept telling us that a bus was being arranged. Finally at 3am they hired some taxis and took us to a decent hotel. No food or drinks was offered to us during the course of our wait and Ahmedabad airport is very poorly equipped with food stalls. We we're boarded onto a new flight the following day. Though diversions cannot be controlled by the airline the customer care can surely be looked into.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As far as I know and being travelled on other airlines for international trip. Shopping at Duty free is not considered as Hand baggage weight. Wait this is Indigo. You would find some one waiting at the boarding counter with weight machine. And charged me for the extra weight just for the shopping at Duty free. What more the person carries only manual slip. No credit cards accepted not even USD or INR (Globally accepted currency / Home currency). Had to go back to the currency counter to exchange. This was horrible experience had to shell out additional 1500 bucks (40 AED / Kg). Plus went inside and saw some seats at emergency exit were empty. Asked the cabin crew if I can sit at emergency exit as have some extra leg space answer I got was that I would have to pay extra if I want to sit. They would rather keep the seat vacant then let some one sit. Very disappointed with the approach.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I do have a suggestion: the designers of the new Calcutta airport omitted to provide any kind of elevator/lift connection - to assist passengers with luggage - for those transferring from arrivals (ground floor) to departures (first floor). Maybe IndiGo can have a staff member on the ground floor to assist arriving IndiGo passengers transferring to departures and carrying heavy luggage?","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

However it took the airline 42 minutes to deliver baggage - first bag was delivered at 22.42 hrs! Bangalore Airport is very efficient and I have not experienced baggage delays in the past 3 years - both domestic and international flights. This delay was primarily due to inefficiency and bad co-ordination amongst the ground staff. Today IndiGo Airlines ground staff were pathetic and inactive - they repeated baggage will be on belt in 2 minutes while it actually took over 40 minutes. No supervisory staff were available to address the issue. Rain had stopped when this flight landed. Since this flight had no aerobridge facility we had to disembark from the flight - walk down an uncovered ramp into the bus. None of us were wet - but airline ground staff observed heavy rain to delay baggage delivery by 40 minute! Indigo Flight 6E 412 from Kochi to Bangalore landed at 22.06 hrs even this flight was late. But the last bag for this Indigo flight was on belt at 22.24 hrs. If the same airline can deliver bags for a flight that landed 4 minutes after the Mumbai-Bangalore flight how can they blame the weather system! I don't see any reason other than staff inefficiency and bad co-ordination for this delay.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This is an outstanding low-cost airline. I couldn't really find any fault with them! All staff were very friendly professional and helpful the planes were modern and spotless the captain gave informative and friendly announcements before during and after the flight the food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced; and the inflight magazine was well-produced. In Delhi we got stuck in a traffic jam caused by a sudden storm and so we only arrived at the aiport about 10 minutes before the flight. We assumed that we would miss the flight and have to make a plan B but the excellent and helpful staff quickly issued us boarding passes and rushed us to the plane so we still got away on time.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

After take off we were offered drinks despite Indigo being a budget airline. I felt a little hungry halfway through the flight and I manger to get a packet of chips for a cheap price.

The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them. This flight is really short- ca 37 mins from take-off to touch-down so not much time to offer paid (or pre-paid) meals. In general comparing to European 'no frills' airlines IndiGo presents generally a better offering and service.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes. Also they appear to have recently dropped their domestic baggage allowance from 20kg to 15kg per passenger. Excess baggage fees are reasonable if prepaid online but be aware of this especially if you are connecting to an onward international flight.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Given the hype about this airline I thought of giving them a try and they didn't disappoint. Website was easy to use. However I wish they'd allow pre-booking of seats at least for a nominal fee. You have to buy 'Indigo Plus' which is meals + seat so if you don't want a meal there will be no seat selection. Aircraft was an A320 and it was in excellent condition. Cabin crew was polite and friendly. Food is available for sale and water is provided in cups free of charge.

I was not informed of any impending cancellations or delays and proceeded to the airport a normal. Upon arrival I was very politely informed that no departures had taken place this day and Indigo were unsure when departures would take place. They immediately asked me if I would like to take the first available flight on the day but because of the fog and my return on the same evening I declined and requested them if they could delay and reschedule this by a few days later which they happily and professionally did at no extra cost or dreaded penalties. The whole affair was so well handled I was most impressed by Indigo's ground staff. This is one rare gem in the Indian aviation scene.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Once on board on our flight to Singapore we found the seats spacious and comfortable the crew courteous and professional. The inflight service was excellent and reasonably priced.

The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change.

This was my first time on SpiceJet, a low-cost carrier -- though after paying for securing a seat, a snack, and to make the reservation -- the total price exceeded that of a full service operator! To secure my seat, I had to also pay for a snack! I chose the flight entirely because of its timing -- it was convenient for my plans. On the day prior to the departure I received a text message that the flight had been ""preponed"" by a hour because of runaway repairs at Dhaka. Appreciated this update. At the airport, SpiceJet's international counter opened about 90 minutes prior to the flight's departure. A man checked passports to determine if visa to Bangladesh was in order. He sat at a counter that said ""Air India"" - this confused some of us. The twin engine propeller plane was parked out on the tarmac and a bus ferried the passengers to it. The short flight was smooth though loud. Flight attendants were efficient. My vegetarian sandwich was dry; I needed to pay extra to get a water. Although the flight got me to my destination in reasonable comfort, the airline seems to focus on the mass market.

One of these flights was a flight from Delhi to Goa. Shortly over a week before we were due to fly, SpiceJet notified us that the flight was cancelled due to a runway closure. Frustrating of course, but apparently out of their control, so we were initially understanding. What was in SpiceJet’s control however was the customer service experience that followed. To summarise what has been a truly horrendous experience spanning 3 months. SpiceJet could offer no alternative flight that day, so I we had to book an alternative flight at 3 x the price. Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ‘km by km basis’ rather than the price paid for each leg, leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive. SpiceJet erroneously refunded only 1 passenger of the 2 on the cancelled leg, leaving us an additional 7000 INR out of pocket. After querying this we were told the refunded amount was correct and that this was the end of the matter. It took 7 phone calls spanning 3-4 hours, over a period of 5 weeks to receive the refund for the 2nd passenger. Each of these phone calls was to a different agent and involved explaining the situation from the beginning each time and battling the front line denials and scripted replies in order to actually discuss the issue. We were assured on each of these phone calls that the refund had already been processed (it hadn’t) or that it would be processed (it wasn’t). Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us, more than a month later. From the UK we spent over £50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded. In total due to a combination of administrative failures on SpiceJet’s behalf, we are out of pocket approximately 22,000 INR (£250 GBP). After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2,000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused. All in all, this has single-handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company, anywhere in the world. SpiceJet may get you from A to B, but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues, prepare for a time consuming, fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience. For your own sanity, I highly recommend you avoid this company at all costs.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Our time in Delhi should have been 3 hours which was considered more than enough to catch our next flight. After the boarding was over and all the passengers were already on the plane, Spicejet allowed a group of people standing on the plane stares to literally stop the plane from departing. No one announced us what was going on, even though we asked several questions and insisted that most of the passengers have other flight connections to catch in Delhi. At some point, a stewardess told us that the people from the stairs insisted that the plane has to wait for another two people to join the flight. No clarification was brought to us. It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain, or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that the crew did nothing, but waited for 1,5 hours after the boarding was finished. The passengers asked them to call the police or the airport security but nothing happened for 1,5 hours. It was a huge chaos. At some point, many passengers, tourist mainly step out of the plane, arguing with the group of people who wanted to stop the plane for departing. No reaction again from the Spicejet crew. Due to this delay, many passengers from the plane lost our connection flights and had to pay a substantial amount of money to change our flight tickets. Please be your own judge if it is acceptable that in 2017 companies like Spicejet should exist on the market?","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

To be honest, I am a bit of a patron when it comes to SpiceJet. I have lived through the worst phase of the airline in 2014 when cancellations were more common than on-time flights. However, what has struck me over the last 2 years is the transformation that the airline has seen. While most of us would assume that one man cannot weave magic, Mr. Ajay Singh seems to have done precisely that. The flights take off on time, the planes are clean as a classroom, the food is served hot and the crew are courteous. The long queues at the airport seem to magically disappear without any halla-bulla! Yet it is affordable for middle-class blokes like me. Wonder what the SpiceJet formula is!

SpiceJet, as you may know is a low budget airline, but who knew in this case that low budget means lowest quality? My family and I started our return flight back to Dubai with discomfort, for our seats were positioned directly in front of the emergency exit doors. So whilst we couldn't recline our seats, those in front of us could. Let me just say this resulted in little to no room for sitting, reading, or even for that matter sleeping. To provide a more visual description we were literally trapped in our seats, so if you get claustrophobic either pray you get a better seat or better yet I would recommend avoiding the flight itself. This dissatisfaction didn't stop there. The food which my sister and I had specifically pre ordered due to our dietary constraints (paleo) and already paid for was not available. As we couldn't eat any of the other meals available, we had to order 2-3 other meals and scrape at whatever we would be able to eat, which wasn't a lot as the portion sizes were extremely small, in comparison to the food available at the airport which we didn't consume due to the fact that our pre-ordered meals would be served on the plane. This review is specifically targeting SpiceJet's management and organization, not its cabin crew who were in fact very helpful with providing additional meal alternatives for us. It's a shame to think that these issues could have easily been avoided if my family and I had been informed of our seating locations prior to boarding. Sadly SpiceJet's management found it too difficult to pick up a phone to inform us about our seat arrangements and the unavailability of our meal options.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-67-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4-1-50x50.png","; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-67-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4-1-500x500.png","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-67-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4-1-500x500.png","; ","Type Of Traveller

They announced to see the menu and let us know your choice, we’ll bring that you. I decided to go for Veg Biryani and my wife wanted Paneer Tikka Masala. When she came to take the order, we mentioned above choices but she replied that they only have Veg Cappa Noodles and Bhel. My point here is that when they have only 2 options then why can’t they make it clear in the announcement rather than giving opportunity to customer of choosing the food they like from menu and waste time. We decided to go for only left options Bhel & Cappa Noodle, so when she came to serve us the same then she asked for 350 Rs./-, I offered US Dollars because I found that in menu that they had 2 prices mentioned against each item, one in rupees and another in USD and I did have US Dollars with me (Because my current residential status is US, so my preferred way to spend money was US Dollars). She replied “let me check whether we have change for this or not” I said Ok. She came back after long and mentioned we don’t accept US Dollars in Indian flights, US dollars mentioned in menu is for our (Spicejet) international section only. The point here is when this is the rule then why she did not make it clear when I offered US Dollars in the beginning, why did she tell me that “let me check whether we have change or not”. I offered Credit Card, she said Machine is not working. Then finally I offered my last preferred mode of payment “Cash in INR” and then she accepted that and returned me the change. The staff who was dealing with me was very rude not only to me but I found her same behavior to others as well. The point here is that I would not be complaining here if things were dealt with smile and hospitality. Mistakes can be ignored if there is a humbleness and soft skills. But mistakes with rudeness and bad attitude is always a bad combination and worst specially when you work in a service industry.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I reached the Bangalore airport at around 12:30 so as to avoid any hassles. Then all of a sudden I see that our flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad has got delayed to around 18:10 and my other connecting flight from Hyderabad to Chandigarh was at 17:50 from Hyderabad. So there was no way I could get this flight. So, I asked Spicejet to provide any alternate flight to Chandigarh. As there were some other flights working for this area. But they said they can't do that and told me that they can provide a flight from Bangalore to Delhi which will depart from Bangalore at 21:10 and will reach New Delhi at 00:05 and then next flight from New Delhi to Chandigarh at 07:10 and will reach Chandigarh at 08:05. They said I have no other options. When I asked for hotel/Lounge service as there is a total delay of nearly 12 hours to reach Chandigarh. They simply denied and said no such facilities are provided. They just provided 1 basic lunch. I had to spend more than 6 Hours in the Bangalore Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility and nearly 7 Hours in the New Delhi Airport with no Airport lounge/hotel facility. If this delay would be 30 minutes or 1 hour then I would have let it go. But this is not acceptable. I won't recommend Spicejet to anyone.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

My flight from Bangkok to Delhi was 30 minutes delayed which was acceptable. However, the return trip from Delhi was absolutely terrible. They announced 6 hours prior to departure time that the flight was 1.5hrs delayed. When I reached the gate, there was another 30 mins delay. I also bought SpiceMAX package including seat leg room, priority check-in, boarding and bagguages and meals. This deal seemed okay until we wait for the baggages at the arriving airport. No priority baggage existed! All normal and prioritized baggages are mixed up. We have to wait for 30 mins till we got our ""priority"" bags. Additionally, the seats are cramped and the gap between rows are extremely narrow.

I was keen on trying their Spicemax product which I did and wasn't happy about it. The Spicemax product offers seats with more legspace at the two front rows, priority check-in baggage arrival and complementary beverage and snacks. I feel the only reason you can buy the product is if you want priority arrival of your checked in baggage. Keeping in mind the price you pay for the product, the legspace, food and beverage quality was quite ordinary. You would rather want to be in the economy seat and buy meals and drinks on board or from elsewhere. It's much cheaper that way. The legspace, contrary to their claims, didn't seem all that wide. I am a short man but felt a taller passenger would struggle there. The airhostesses were polite and answered my enquiry about beverage choice available. Didn't interact with them much but from whatever I felt, it was fine. The captain or first officer kept quiet throughout and didn't provide any update on weather, arrival or location. The flight left on time and arrived before the time mentioned in the ticket which was good. To summarise, don't buy Spicemax ticket, especially if you don't have any baggage for check-in.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

The thought of 212 pax in an all economy configuration made me think that I would feel compressed in a tin can. However, the comfortable seats, very professional and friendly cabin crew and the background music (Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie) reminded me of how a flight must actually be.

I was able to get this ticket cheaply, about 20$, which is very cheap. At the airport, the check-in line wasn't bad. At security check there was line cutting from other people which was very frustrating, but it isn't airline's fault. To start with, value for money was absolutely 5 stars. The check-in staff looked like he worked 24/7 for 50 years; he was not kind, and I felt he wasn't willing to help. For ground service itself, I went to the plane by bus since jetways can't be connected to Q400, so beware. For seat comfort, it was very narrow. Seat pitch was average for LCC but felt shorter than IndiGo's A320. I was able to rest and the seat was comfortable to sleep. For cabin service, it was not bad but not great. Cabin crew were well trained and took care of passenger safety and told passengers to remain seated after the landing. Other than that, everything was average. For food and beverages, they provided water for free and the average cost of items is about 300 rupees. Overall, I do recommend this airline despite its little bit ""rude"" ground staffs. The flight ticket is extremely cheap, so you can expect to save your budget for a delicious meal at the airport. Flight crews are little over average, and seats were comfortable considering that it's a LCC.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Within a minute I was at the gate and they say the flight has been cleared and will be pushing back. My question why I was called if the flight was cleared was not answered and also I wanted them to put the time and reason for boarding denial on my boarding pass. This was not done and they swiftly took me to security check and asked me to leave. There again the problem starts. The staff at the main exit gate will not allow you to leave unless staff update the records. I had to run behind the staff for half an hour to get it done and get out.

Seats cushioning was good (better than Indigo) but space was a constraint. As my ticket was a Corporate one, meal was included. I was served a full breakfast (consisting of Idli, Vada, Uttapam, Sambhar, croissant and butter). This itself was pretty heavy and I was impressed with the meal (Indigo fares so low on the meal part). After that crew asked me if I wanted a beverage. Opted for tea. They gave me a big cup of tea along with a large cookie. There was no end to the breakfast. Was hugely impressed with the service and the professionalism of the crew.

I had 3 flights booked with this airline in the same month - the first was delayed by over 3 hours, the second was rescheduled to an earlier time without any communication and the third was fraught with airport handling issues. Good communication and empathy softens even the toughest customers and yet this airline does not understand this very basic of customer service. Not only did the airline not understand the impact of the delays/reschedule, they dismissed the claim of paying the fare difference for the second flight which we had to book urgently on another airline which ended up costing us more than the value of the entire trip (4 flight legs). I warn potential customers - do not be tempted by the lower cost that this airline purports to offer - the delays and reschedule will end up costing you an arm and a leg. There are other low cost airlines in India and I strongly advise you to travel with them over Spicejet. I am not sure how many people find the time to write a review but I did hear chatter at the gate (for the first flight that was delayed by over 3 hours) from other passengers who said they have also never seen an airline with this terrible on time performance. I have rated the airline 1 on some aspects below only because there is no option of a negative rating.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

After lot of follow up with Mumbai I received my 1 bag. Other bag was still missing.

Even the customer service did not give clear reply. I came back to Dubai on 24th and on 27th found out that my bag was lying in Dubai only. This is the co-ordination level of Spicejet. Even after 27th the customer service team writes to me that they are working on the same and will get back asap (what a great level of co-ordination).

No provision of extra water, we had to buy that. When asked about the flight at 11 pm which was the timing after first delay the crew said ""we have no idea"" and were reluctant to call the manager.

When we reached Delhi an onboard announcement was made that our checked-in baggage was to be collected from belt 2. After about half the baggage had been put on belt 2, further bags stopped coming and even the sign on the belt changed to Indigo airlines. After about 10 minutes some passengers discovered their bags on belt 3 which was assigned to Indigo. Another 30 minutes passed. No baggage. Some 30 passengers waiting. The Spicejet desk informed one of us that all baggage had been offloaded and had been delivered. Shortly, a ground assistant of the airline came to the belt and upon being asked what had happened to the bags told us, ""Such things happen"". Meanwhile, baggage of a subsequent Spicejet flight starts coming on belts 2 and 3 which are both having signage of Indigo Another 15 minutes go by. She is still circulating among the irate passengers, ""In a little while I shall find out what the problem is."" or ""I will have to go to the aircraft to find out what the problem is."" or ""Why are you complaining to me?"" Eventually, after a wait of 65 minutes, the rest of the bags start trickling in, one at a time with long gaps in between. After my bag came, I asked her, ""Where are our bags?"" Her reply, ""Give me some time to find out"" A totally clueless dead-loss customer relations executive. I had flown Spicejet after a gap of many years. On earlier flights I had found them customer-unfriendly and had boycott them for years.

At check-in the Spicejet employee asked to see the credit card I booked the tickets with. I explained that between booking my tickets and travelling, my card had expired and I had been given a new one by my bank. Hardly a rare occurrence, I would assume. I had to explain this to him three times but he still asked the same question. He eventually called his supervisor who also asked me the same question, forcing me to explain again. She then called another supervisor who checked my passport and let us check in. This caused quite a delay and unnecessary annoyance. However, when we boarded and departed (on time) the service was excellent - friendly and welcoming cabin staff, clean and comfortable cabin with decent leg room (I'm 6'1"" and it was more than ok for a few hours) and good value/tasty food. I'd definitely fly with Spicejet again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Service at the counter was efficient and prompt. I exceeded my check-in weight limit but the counter staff acknowledged that I had no handcarry and allowed me to check in the excess weight as well, and this left a very positive impression of IndiGo. On 6th February I took a flight from Kashmir to Amritsar using SpiceJet. No complains although nothing was memorable. Most likely because my baggage was underweight and I had no Handcarry. On 9th February I had another flight with SpiceJet from Amritsar to Delhi. This time my baggage exceeded the weight limit. I had no handcarry but the staff was adament I remove items from the baggage and handcarry them. It is a simple request which can be adhered if communicated well. I was in queue for almost half an hour and shoved left and right between counters. I maintained my cool because I understand the staff was busy. Once again the counter staff told me to continue waiting as passengers from earlier flights will need to check in first. Does that mean the counter staff will rudely tell you off to remove the excess weight immediately or pay the additional fees. I am expected to wait for ages for the counter to serve me but when I am need to remove the items from my baggage, I have to let all other people to finish checking-in? Another group of passengers were complaining and they got served immediately. So should I assume that manners are not appreciated by SpiceJet? As a result the staff does not have respect for the passengers? My flight to Delhi was scheduled at 4.10pm. My boarding pass said 2.55pm. When I asked the staff about the timing, they don't know what time will the flight depart. They told me to wait and listen to the announcement.

We also learned that they had empty seats. We explained to the manager that we had to leave Sri Lanka because our visa was just about finished. He offered no help, and wouldn't even call the main office to get us a seat on the plane. So we were forced to buy a new ticket on SriLanka Airlines at the airport, and fly out that way. As I write this, I have emailed SpiceJet three times to get our money back. And understand that our tickets are still good for another week. So far, the only response I get from their customer support, is that I need to write someone else, but they don't tell me who that is.

Overall, it was a very average experience. The ground staff were very friendly and welcome. However, the cabin crew was the opposite as they looked tired and although they tried to be friendly, they weren't welcoming. The vegetarian subs they had on board was pathetic and considering the cheap quality, the price charged for the subs was quite high. The cabin experience is standard as you really can't expect much from a regional aircraft like the Q400 but I really feel that Colombo being an international sector with high demand, SpiceJet needs to use a Boeing 737.

Since I didnt have much of Rupees i decided to pay in Dirhams. I offered 100 AED for an item of 15AED. They said they didnt have change so I had to skip dinner. They also didnt have most of the items shown in the menu card. There was no TV in the flight which made it boring.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

My problem this time is non receipt of baggage in Dubai. After checking with the Lost baggage office, they show us a list of passengers whose baggage were offloaded. There was no airline staff to guide stranded passengers. We came to know that 25 bags were offloaded. After filing the lost baggage complaint, there was no way to reach SpiceJet office to arrange delivery in Abu Dhabi the next day. Finally reached them in their India toll free number. However they were not willing to deliver in Abu Dhabi. Finally I had to make arrangement to collect from Dubai airport. Their customer service was very poor. Very bad customer service. Only trying to increase their revenue at all cost.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

It started off right from Dubai airport at check-in. My flight was meant to depart at 23:10hrs. The display said 23:10 when we entered the queue and within minutes the display for Delhi departure turned to 02:20hrs. A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said ""sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies"". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service. Not even water was offered to the passengers - only those who asked got it. At one point I woke up and went to the galley to ask for water and the air hostesses were asleep! Unacceptable standards of service. Agreed SpiceJet is a budget airline but even so there is something called professionalism which was totally lacking here. Needless to say, I am not looking forward to my return flight.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

When enquired with the cabin crew they didn't have any concrete answers. Anyway flight landed on time. Kochi-DEL. Flight was scheduled to leave at 7pm from Kochi but delayed by 1.5-2 hrs. It was scheduled to stop at Mumbai but changed to Hyderabad. At Hyderabad no one was sure whether we continue in the same flight or change planes. After 10-20 mins we learnt that we needed to get on another plane. Again we got the message that meals are not available in the flight and even no water bottle given to us in all the flights. I am not sure why they still have the meal option on their website. In terms of ticket pricing rates are cheaper than other airlines but it doesn't matter if they are not able to provide the basic things.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Check-in was chaotic but ground staff were efficient and helpful. Flight on a new 737 but legroom was tight but the seats were ok for a short 3 hour flight. Service was extremely inefficient it felt like the cabin crew did not go through proper training. It took them more than 2 hours to service the entire aircraft and we were lucky enough that we pre-ordered our meals beforehand. Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality. The quality and quantity were great and while it was just a basic meal the taste far exceeds that of other major airlines like Emirates. Overall a mediocre flight.

Both times the flight was delayed by 15-30 minutes from the scheduled departure. The biggest let down about Spicejet is the fact that they have a very extensive food menu but they don't have any food or beverages onboard (except for water). I had pre-booked and paid for a meal (Chicken Sandwich) for my onward flight which was never served to me. The reason given to me was that there was no food available onboard. Don't get fooled by the pre-booking discount (20%) they offer as they charge a convenience fee which eventually escalates the price more than buying the same meal on flight. The FA's just keep running from one end of the fuselage to the other carrying papers in their hand. I can't recommend Spicejet.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Of those 5 three were cancelled without any issues with weather/external circumstance (i.e. all internal SpiceJet operational issues) and one was delayed by 2 hours. Only one flight managed to make it to the destination on time. Worse SpiceJet does not pay for hotels or offer any sort of recompense when they cancel a flight due to operational issues (including not having enough passengers) all they offer is to book you on the next available SpiceJet fight (note that they refuse to buy you a ticket on any other airline) which is usually the next day and forces you to either pay for an additional hotel night out of pocket or lose a night that you had already paid for. They don't even offer to make the seat selection free after forcing you to change your plans completely. The additional 250 rupee charge is just a slap in the face after they tell you there is nothing they can do about completely disrupting your travel a day before you are supposed to leave. They are the worst Indian airline. Not only does SpiceJet not get you to your destination on time you're usually a day late.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My destination was Goa. Our boarding started 15 minutes prior to departure and there was a mess with the stamp on my boarding pass. So we had to go back to the security check area and get a stamp on - ground staff was polite and they had the bus waiting for us. We took off from Mumbai relatively on time and reached Goa in 45 minutes contrary time given by airline which was 1h 05m. I found the seat comfortable with enough legroom. We didn't buy food in-flight for a 45 min flight. The staff of SpiceJet was most polite I have seen.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The captain was prompt enough to explain the reason for the delay hence there was no confusion. Clean aircraft with attentive cabin crew. Return flight at night was delayed 2 hours but was informed about the same in the afternoon through a text message which I think is a positive step. The flight to Chennai was operated by an all women crew which I think is a first as far as the low cost airlines in India are concerned. Overall good experience.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The check-in procedure was quite disorganised with the longest possible line for any airline I could see at Bombay. Their website says you cannot do web check-in if you need to check in baggage. For an early morning flight this rule makes you leave home at least half an hour before other airlines. Staff allotted me an aisle seat in the non-reclining row before exit without informing me since I am relatively tall the leg space was quite insufficient the only reason to be thankful was the gentleman in front of me did not recline his seat. Overall have had better experiences on other Indian budget airlines like Indigo. Staff are good but could do with some more training.

The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful.

However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages.

All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear.

This airline is the most unhelpful company I have ever dealt with. I would avoid booking with them if you possibly can. My 19 year old son's flight was cancelled with no explanation for his return from a holiday. Along with his friends they were not offered alternative flights at first and we had to sort things for the back in the UK. Additionally when we did manage to get them a flight it only went to Leeds were they were left stranded with no support to get them back to Liverpool. No offer of compensation and after trying to contact the airline who refused to talk to us and did not respond to any emails or messages sent. This is a disgrace, customer service is non existent. Additional the second flight was also delayed by an additional 5 hours and again no offer of a drink, meal or anyone willing to speak to them. Overall the delay consisted of over 10 hours and 5 19 year olds being stranded in Leeds.","Not Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Had 2 flights with Ryanair, and each flight was the absolute worst. My girlfriend and I checked in 3 days in advance and we were not given seats next to each other, even though the tickets were ordered at the same time and we could *see* that the seats next to each of us were available. Ryanair then prompted us ""Want to sit together?"" We could upgrade. Basically they tried to charge us extra money to get the service that you get included in every other flight. Obviously we didn't do that, and when we got on the flight it was mostly empty and everyone could sit wherever they wanted. Ryanair wasn't doing this splitting the seating to 'improve seating algorithm' or 'allow larger groups'- they were doing it solely to milk another couple bucks out of us from our ticket. Same thing in a different vein for every other aspect of the trip from boarding to arriving - boarding groups, luggage, etc. There must have been a dozen different upgrades you could purchase to bring the quality of their ticket up to the standard quality of every other existing airline. Obviously every airline does this to some extent, but the breaking up seating was the one that really got to me. Their carry-on luggage options were just as bad on paper, though the actual flight attendants were very relaxed about what could and couldn't be brought on a flight. That might depend on the people though- on paper, you would struggle to bring anything onto this flight for free as a carry-on. Caused a lot of needless anxiety as we were preparing to leave our backpacks worked for 99% of other airlines, but would they cost us $80 to bring through Ryanair? If they aren't going to enforce the luggage stuff they should relax it on paper so it doesn't cause travelers so much stress. On top of that, every other part of the trip was irritating in every way. Boarding process started ~30 minutes late for both of our flights. They accidentally left us stuck in a hot and crowded staircase for half an hour waiting for a bus. At some point during the flight they tried to sell us scratch-off lottery tickets for additional flights, which was annoying and loud and also just plain *weird*. Despite how late we always boarded, the flight was never late. The pilots cut down the flight by a lot of time. Very noticeable in landing, I've dropped my phone with more grace than some of these landings. I guess this is technically a plus but feeling like your pilot is rushing is never a good feeling on a flight for me. In summary, it was a miserable experience all around. Hard to grade these things since cheapo flights all pretty much suck (you get what you pay for), but some aspects of this like the 'split up seating' really elevated this one to something special.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Boarding was simple and fast, and ground crew were nice and very efficient. No hassle at all. Boarding the plane was also fast, the plane was very clean and the crew were friendly and helpful as ever, I don't particularly like the Boeing 737, seats are narrower than in similar airbus (not Ryanair's fault, it is due to the plane) and I don't particularly like the orange on blue Ryanair scheme. Seats are adequately comfortable for a 2h flight but I wish they had some pockets in front of you to store your belongings. Overhead bins had sufficient space. Crew were friendly and had the usual drinks and food for passengers to buy and the flight was fast and uneventful. Very smooth flight. Deboarding was fast and I didn't have the need to wait for bags as I had not carried any checked in luggage.

I have travelled with Ryanair many time, and am aware that in order to get the low cost airfare you have to follow the rules. I purchased a ticket from Athens to Dublin, 71.39 euros ,[1st may], received the confirmation booking, and the barcode ticket. When I went to board the flight I was told I could not as the payment had not gone through. I was told to go to arrivals and talk with someone in Skyline desk. I never received a email, text or phone call to say that the payment didn't go through. I was given a piece of paper with website, call center and working hours. Could not get through to the phone number so went on live chat with Ryanair, got no help, then i told them how terrible it was to be left in Athens and then i was told to contact the Fraud Department - of course no response. I had to buy a ticket from a travel agent at the airport (so helpful and understand of my situation), go to Paris and then Dublin with Air France, for 210 euro, but money and time well spent. I had the money to book the ticket with the same card I used with Ryanair, and knowing the way Ryanair operates, there was no point in loosing my sanity over a badly run airline. I got back home at 11pm instead of 4.30pm. Beware of booking your flight on the same day [less then 24 hours] - and know what you are getting into with a low budget airline, I feel sorry for the staff that have to front the bad attitude of individuals running Ryanair.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Stansted is awful and it was hot. However we all trooped on in time no issues over seats or baggage - obviously a well travelled bunch. All checked in online - as after all that's what it says when you book the flight (stop moaning about online check in and boarding passes). No problem with seating - spare seats allowed a little flexibility. Staff very pleasant - a little confusion initially as a trainee on board who confused who she needed to get bags put up in the hold. All dealt with a smile and a laugh and we were off. Drinks about average for a flight - arrived on time. Off like a ferret out of a trap at terminal one. Can't complain.

This was my first 'special assistance' flight alone and the staff who were all friendly and helpful went above and beyond normal duties, helping me to my seat, stowing and retrieving my case from the rack and letting me move from my allocated centre seat to a window seat. Check-in staff were equally helpful - special assistance passengers are directed to the Flexi Plus counter - with only one passenger ahead of me and a wheelchair arriving within 5 minutes. I also tried the new Ryanair 'Full Breakfast' of orange juice, sausages,bacon, tomato, rosti and white pudding, Irish bread with butter and marmalade and choice of hot drinks.- served personally by the chief steward as he had never seen one before ! - and can recommend it at €10 having had far worse on big name airlines. Departing I was helped with my luggage to the airport lift and wished a pleasant weekend. With it also being a new aircraft with the more comfortable seats I would rate this as being one of the best flights, long or short haul that I have had in recent years.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

My husbands colleagues bought us RyanAir vouchers as a wedding present. It was intended for both the bride and the groom of course. However they were the colleagues of my husband, so they bought it in his name. We very carefully planned what to do with these vouchers, when we finally thought that going back to Azores is the best way to spend them. We were about to pay for the 2 tickets from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada, when the system threw an error that only 4 vouchers can be accepted. We had 8. No problem, we thought. We would buy the tickets individually. So we bought the tickets for my husband, all 4 vouchers went through fine. Then we were going to buy mine, when the system disagreed, because the vouchers were in my husband's name. We contacted RyanAir, to ask for a solution. They have been using our wedding present for almost a year, and we naturally wanted to get something out of it. There only reply both through chat and complaint was that ""please read the terms and conditions."" Well. We are very disappointed, that something that has been intended to make us happy turned out so ugly. They have no flexibility, no customer care, no work arounds, nothing. This a terrible way to manage customer satisfaction.

To ensure I would not experience the same incidents, I read the procedures: bookings, luggage, check in, arrival time, etc. I booked 07:55 flight on 15 April 2018 from Rome Ciampino to Tarbes for myself, with plus service (this includes 20kg checked luggage). I installed Ryanair Apps to check in online (this is to avoid €55 charge for check in at the airport). I arranged my luggage not to exceed 20kg allowance. At the airport I dropped my luggage at check in counter, wait for boarding, everything was fine. During the flight, everything was ok. Seats are non reclining, but hey it's only 1.5hr flight. Legroom was sufficient, I'm only 5'5"" anyway. Service was fine although I did not want to spend my euros for meals on board. After the flight I collected my luggage without hassle. So it was a good experience.

People have been moving around seats, in order to sit with their peers, however as this is a short flight it was not too much. Flights were punctual and almost full. Very cheap (40EUR return).","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Thought I had solved the problem by paying an additional £6 PP Per flight for priority boarding. Only to discover that due again to their policy change this no longer includes early check in. The only way to sit together is to reserve your seats. Which is also a cheaper option than priority boarding but it doesn't tell you this when you make the booking. It is also not possible to change your Priority boarding to reserving a seat! The other point worth mentioning is that when you do book in the 4 day period before you fly, the Ryanair system seems to be designed to ensure that you are as far apart from your family as possible, which causes chaos at boarding as everyone then boards the flight and tries to sit with their family. If I have a choice Ryanair will be my last choice of carrier. No longer the cheap option they once were - they give you the distinct feeling they are trying to rip you off. Most certainly the worst of the cheap airlines! I will not use them again unless there is no other option - even if I have to pay more for the flight. Don't try to complain on the phone - they have no complaints department, just someone who keeps on telling you their policy has changed and to look at their website if you want to complain.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They’re are incredibly greedy for money and cant find enough ways to steal from you. I’ve flown with them before but never again! Firstly the ticket is affordable but each bag costs £40 which means the cost of bags will exceed the ticket (so flying with a more expensive airline with more benefits and quality assurance will technically equal the money you will spend with Ryanair). Secondly, unlike every other airline it now requires you to pay £6 (yes because £80 isnt enough) for you to be able to take a small bag on board. I took a small trolley bag as I knew this was the policy and they still tagged it. My bag had no lock, was not strong enough to be put in the deck and had very delicate things inside. They only gave me time to remove my computer and all my appliances/makeup/many other products were left to be thrown away in the deck (and we both know what happens, bag breaks and all my things inside break). The best part is they only tell you about this policy in an e-mail after you buy the ticket! Yes it is written in the small letters of the terms, yet they know we don't always read it all, especially when I’ve flown with them before and never had to do it so just assumed everthing was the same. When boarding, I realise half the top shelfs were empty which means this could all have been avoided, but like I said, money tops it all for this airline. No customer service quality, terrible unhappy and unfriendly staff in the airplane. All I know is that I have given so much time and money to this airline, but you can be sure I will never fly with them again. Absolutely ridiculous.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/7B4ABFA7-1F3C-432C-AB74-123C702EAA45-e1520939278117-50x50.jpeg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/7B4ABFA7-1F3C-432C-AB74-123C702EAA45-e1520939278117-500x500.jpeg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/7B4ABFA7-1F3C-432C-AB74-123C702EAA45-e1520939278117-500x500.jpeg","","Type Of Traveller

We had bought 2 seats across an aisle together as they were 2.50 each and actually the plane had plenty of empty seats so we ended up sitting together. Had they been dearer I wouldn't have bought the seats and instead more than likely sat at opposite ends of the plane due to that crazy seating algorithm that needs to go! Boarding at Dublin swift and efficient and staff were very nice and courteous on outbound flight. On time arrival into CIA. Due to not having priority boarding our bags were taken off us at the aircraft and we weren't waiting long for them at the terminal. On the way back, a similar pattern, really nice staff on board, highly efficient and pleasant. Interestingly they turned off the cabin lights and toned down the service after about an hour which was really welcome. I have to say the constant selling is tiresome but on this flights the hour and half with dimmed lighted was very pleasant and appreciated by all passengers. Small delay on take off as wind was 15 knots which was too strong under Italian aviation law but we were well updated by flight deck. More notifications as we flew right over Paris and over Heathrow I wouldn't have any problems flying Ryanair again but play by the rules. If you want an allocated seat and carry on luggage take a priority ticket. The price was good and customer service was of a good acceptable and dare I say it more enhanced than on some previous trips.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We've all seen the online blogs about Ryanair's reputation for avoiding compensation claims, but I experienced it first hand when they cancelled my flight to Mallorca just 6 hours before take off back in October of last year, and I lost a fortune in transfers, hotel costs, train fees, travel money etc. I thought it would be very straight forward to get compensation for something for which I was totally blameless. Not so. I contacted Ryanair with all of my proof of purchases, and got an email to say they would pay me nothing because of circumstances ""which was due to a general strike, outside of our control."" I contacted the Ombudsman, Aviation ADR, and they contacted Ryanair on my behalf, and received a reply saying that they still would not compensate me. I went higher up and still nothing. I am continuing to fight this. I'm not going to say I will never fly with them again, because they are cheap.

Bag security takes place at the gate at Frankfurt T2, not on entering the departure lounge (only passport needed). I arrived at the gate ~50 mins before the flight departed (let's face it - at STN with Ryanair you only generally start to board ~5 mins before the departure time) to be confronted with a large queue, all for the same flight. Security did not seem unduly concerned. Far from being last in the queue unfortunately I was directed to a very slow moving parallel screening queue for Xrays etc - which did indeed leave me one of the last downstairs to the gate, where I was witness to a queue of some 20 people already arguing with the gate staff who told them they were ""late"" and could not board. The situation was made more ridiculous as there was a half-empty bus waiting outside, for at least 10 minutes while the team of 2 on the desk refused to let more people past. Eventually this bus departed, only for another one to turn up - again we were not allowed to board this by the gate staff. Someone else turned up and we were effectively told tough, go and re-book as they would not let us through. As a result families were split as the block was seemingly arbitrarily applied from one passenger to the next - which was appalling, moreover he had medication for his wife and they still would not let the guy through nor make any attempt to get these to him. Clearly there was no communication between security and the gate which was hugely frustrating, security was understaffed as they could not physically process the volume of passengers in the timeframe (if I were more suspicious I would think there may be some 'special arrangement' to engineer this). Moreover this happens regularly - one of the gate staff told us *45* people were denied boarding under similar circumstances the day before and a quick twitter search showed this happened at least once more this same week. Overall it was a lousy experience but it seems to be a common problem - be warned if flying Ryanair out of FRA, get to the get super early.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Now it means ""Low fares with loads of hidden costs"". Very poor and unprofessional service from boarding to flight attendants. All starts at boarding where a tag with limited liability is attached to your hand luggage if you don't pay ""Priority"" (which btw, seems to be bought by half the passengers nowadays). The ""fake receipt"" is then glued onto your ID which once resulted in one staff member actually breaking my plastic ID card. This tag is so made up you can just rip it off and try your luck getting your hand bag into the cabin. If you are traveling with your SO or a child, expect to pay just to sit together because it will purposely ""randomly"" allocate you as far as possible. Inside the cabin, you'll find the worst flight attendants the aeronautic industry has to offer. Those who often bump into everyone and will actually hurt you when you have an aisle seat, obviously without any apologies, that keep selling lottery tickets enhancing the flea market spirit even when turbulence requires all passengers to be seated. They sometimes forget to perform the safety procedures demonstration from start because they're on the phone. I once even heard one of them screaming when we ""bumped"" into some turbulence! Good luck trying to sleep if there are constant announcements over food, perfumes, tickets and other diversified sales. Also, Ryanair seems to think they're above EU regulations, no beverages are offered in case of a significant delay. Now the plus: It's simple and sometimes very cheap (although it often requires you to waste tons of money and pay exorbitant train tickets to reach its remote airports) Ryanair keeps growing without proper scaling and training, disregarding its customers and aiming towards maximum profit only. If an airline forgets the holidays of its pilots how can you expect it'll care about its customers?","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Ryanair are one of those airlines that you choose as a last resort. They are just there to scrape every penny they can out of you. We wouldn’t book seats out of principle and refused to pay for priority boarding - this means we could only check in 4 days prior to flying. Luckily I was able to do this, if it was your week/fortnight holiday, you’d be stuck. My husband and son were on a separate booking to me as I had booked later. I checked them in first and got seats 9e and 20b. When I checked in next I got seat 9b. Clearly they could have given my husband seats near each other but they clearly want to make a point. Every time you press proceed you get asked if you want to change your seats at a cost. It’s a pathetic money grabbing system. When we followed this same procedure with Wizz Air, seats next to each other were allocated. The man sat next to me had paid £15 for his seat - I had paid nothing - ridiculous! When we arrived at Stansted we had to wait 30 mins for the belt number to come up. Surprise, surprise all the missing belt numbers were for Ryanair flights.

At check-in Ryanair makes money by separating you from your family and loved ones. There was no room at all to pay for the seat so me and my family could sit together. I got 5D my mum got 1C and my dad got 17C so we were quite separated from each other. The cabin crew said ""When everyone is seated we will see where we can put all 3 of you to sit together"". Before push back a cabin crew member collected me and said go to row 2 and sit on the E seat, my dad was waiting for me. After all, my mum was siting in 1C me and my dad were sitting in Row 2 at D and E. It was really pleasing to sit in one of the front rows. One of the cabin crew was full of energy she was the best stewardess I have ever experienced travelling with! The landing was really rough as it was windy in Dublin. The captain warned us before take-off that we will have quite a rough landing due to strong winds. I was eating chicken sandwich and a Nutella-Go, the Chicken sandwich was one of the best budget airline offered food that I have eaten. We all had a good time travelling with Ryanair.

Overall service standard is basic. Whilst there is nothing wrong with the airline, it is certainly a ""no-frills"" airline. Cheap fares, but expensive extras. Almost the same price to check in my luggage as I paid for my seat. The cabin crew could perhaps pay more attention to the passengers. When serving drinks and snacks, they missed out row 26 altogether. Slight delay due to a technical issue with the aircraft, however we were transferred efficiently to another aircraft, meaning the delay was restricted to *just* 61 minutes. I was travelling with a family member on the same booking, however, we were not allocated seats together. This is not the first time we have been separated in the past few months with Ryanair.

Sit next to your parnter - Add £24 to the cost of the journey. Add 1 check in bag - Add £80 to the cost of the journey. Take your carry on bags on board the plane - add £50 to the cost of the journey. The seats are the worst and most uncomfortable I have ever sat in on a plane and they seem to be adding more rows which means even less leg room, and I'm not a tall man so I really feel for people over 6 feet tall. They called the passengers to the gate and kept us waiting for over 45 additional minutes with nor aircon so it was like sitting in an oven.

However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude. And of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?). Never trust Ryanair for anything. They prove to be one of the worst scammer airline companies there is.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Ryanair, while servicing its customers with prices that are reasonable for flights in nearby countries (such as in my case, when visiting Spain, and flying to Morocco), knows nothing about customer satisfaction or conflict resolution. Aside from experiencing technical difficulties upon departing to Morocco when trying to check-in, my flight prior to and when boarding was equal, and my experience incredibly poor. The flight was announced to be delayed only 30 minutes, when the plane really landed over 2 hours later than scheduled. This caused for me to be stranded at the airport late in the night, as I arranged with my hotel to be picked up from the Marrakesh (RAK) airport, making me feel very unsafe. During the flight, one of the male flight attendants was being very flirtatiously aggressive with two women traveling together that I was sitting next to on the plane. Every time, in passing, the male flight attendant would take the opportunity to engage in unprofessional behavior with one girl in particular. At one point, the two exchanged phone numbers and planned to meet after the flight landed in Marrakesh (RAK), and this event caught the attention of other passengers on the flight. Also, en route, many of the passengers that were traveling in groups were kneeling in the seats, and talking to friends that were sitting behind them. This happened in multiple groups and was never addressed by airline staff. My experience with Ryanair has been frustrating and communicated very clearly to those working with Ryanair, three times. Unfortunately, it seems that Ryanair is a company that knows its own rules and regulations very well, and if you do not (as a passenger), you are considered unfortunate and will only receive a mere apology for any uneventful experience had with the airline. Paying a small amount more for another airline is much advised.","Not Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They were late and the staff was agitated because of it. They boarded priority travellers first without checking their tickets, so that half of the travellers profited and skipped the line without having the right to do so. We didn't want to ruin our evening, so we didn't object, we just wanted to get home smoothly. After boarding the aircraft and after having found a small space in the cabin storage compartment to store our coats, two late passengers arrived, each of them carrying a rather large suitcase. Without saying anything, the flight attendant took our coats out of the storage compartment from above our heads and into my wife's lap. She then pushed one of the suitcases inside and left. No explanation, no intention of helping us store our coats somewhere else. My wife stood up and tried to store the coats somewhere else. This got the staff angry, because they were keen on making up lost time and wanted to depart as soon as possible. They started shouting through the microphone, urging everybody to take their seats and saying that taking your seat is really easy to do. Not only were we denied our minimal confort, decency and respect, but they were now also offending us in public. When I asked them, during the flight, if their attitude seemed normal to them, they started shouting again and they immediately joined the one I was adressing as to create pressure and intimidate us. It was unbelievably rude and hostile.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

A few days before we were due to fly there was the threat of Ryanair going on strike on the day of our flight 20th Dec, which had me regretting my choice however it was averted and our scheduled flight was unaffected. The flight itself was as good as can be expected. The cabin crew especially 1 young woman was friendly and welcoming. As there were several empty seats at the front they allowed passengers to use those seats. The plane took off more or less on time and arrived to Birmingham on schedule. 1 thing I will say about the priority boarding is, it's worth the extra money, it allows you and your partner/family sit together and gives some order to boarding having 2 lanes, I remember when it was 1 queue of boarding it was chaotic and seemed much longer to board.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I had a ""Priority "" ticket"". Even though I flew all the way with Ryanair I had to purchase two separate tickets and therefore had to check in twice. Once in Knock and again in Stansted. We were an hour late leaving Knock, no apologies or explanation. My flight to Athens was for 6.10pm but I wasn't allowed to go to the departure lounge until check in opened and had to hang around the arrival hall for three hours. One coffee shop and a fast food joint, nowhere to sit. Finally get to check in and there aren't any employees! In the check in area, 10 out of 20 weigh stations weren't working and when I found one that worked it was after three attempts. There was one lady outside the check in counter and her job was to tell you to lift your case into the conveyor belt and scan the boarding pass. Didn't offer to help anyone. I checked in one case and had one carry-on and a small bag. The carry on was fine from Knock to Stansted but was not acceptable Stansted to Athens! This I learned while boarding so my carry on went into the cargo. I didn't have time to open it to get some items that I wanted to ""carry-on"". Flight was supposed to leave at 6.10pm. They called us to the gate at 5.25pm and we stood there until 6.35pm, finally told to proceed, got stuck on the stairs 15 minutes and to add insult to injury another 10 minutes in freezing temperatures at the bottom of the steps attached to the aircraft. We eventually left at 7.10pm, an hour late. Again, no apologies or explanations. Of course I was delayed in Athens because I had to wait for two bags instead of one! I will never fly with them again unless it's absolutely necessary.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

That Ryanair is low fare is well known and so I did expect not to have much space on the plane and that I was able to take one bag into the cabin if lucky. When I was already sitting on the plane from Bratislava to Stansted I received my e-mail that my flight from Stansted to Aalborg was canceled and I could not get off the plane to Stansted because it was too late. In Stansted, I was told that I have to wait 26 hours for a next flight and I had a right to have a refund and at least a hotel room where to stay till the next day. After waiting for 7 hours at the customer service I was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available. After another 3 hours they told me at the customer service that they don't know anything about a hotel room and that they will give me a standby ticket to Billund and I can try to catch it, because in that time I had less than an hour and there have been more standby tickets and they took just limited amount of them. It was hell, but after problems at the airport check-in and running for life (and plane) I got there. I arrived in Billund at late night and I had to travel to Aalborg by buses until the morning. I asked for refunds and they told me that I will receive them within 10 working days. That was in September 2017. I did not receive anything and I tried to contact them multiple times but either I was ignored completely or they just wrote me that they forwarded my e-mails and complains to different departments. In December 2017 I finally was able to contact them and account department of Ryanair wrote me that I will have my refunds on my account within 28 days. 28 working days passed and I haven't seen a penny. Honestly, I would not recommend using this airline no matter what. If you have a chance to use a different airline or transport please do. If you have a problem they are sending your messages from one department to another or they just ignore it saying that they have a lot to solve and its not only their online service but customer service at the airport and cabin staff as well.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The new rules about not having the right to bring your hand luggage with you on the plane (small purse + small hand luggage as typical) is absurd. Now you have to pay to be sure not to get it in the hold. In my case, I had another flight to catch so I needed to have my hand luggage with me which forced me to pay the extra price. Furthermore, we are two travelling, and when I made the checkin online the system gave us two seats far away from each other. Next option was; ""You are sitting apart, do you want to sit next to each other?"" Click yes, and an extra supplement is charged to change one of the seats to be next to the other one.

Also, it's really great that they abolished the visa check requirement for Schengen flights for non-EU passport holders. All flights were completely booked but this didn't cause any problems. The only minor drawback is - a lot of advertisements during the flight. Generally, it was an amazing experience, especially for a low-cost carrier.

Check in has been a bad suprise, since the ""random"" seat assignment resulted in 8 people seating in 8 different rows! Before confirming this seat assignement a notice prompted me to pay if I wanted the freedom to choose seats. This is exactly as any other low cost airline promises in theory, since most airlines advertises that you have to pay to choose your seat. Recent experiences on other low cost airlines (easyJet, Wizz Air, Vueling) however resulted in all the people booked together being seated together without any extra cost. For this reason I was surprised to have all of us scattered around the plane. Except this, the flight was good and on time. Seat Comfort is average for low cost. Anyway I feel this ""trying to force"" the extra charge for choosing the seat is a bit rude and out of common low cost market practices.

I was trying to write to Ryanair to at least get some discount on my next flight since the delay was on them but I can't even get in touch with them because they have it in the system that the delay was under 3hrs so by European law it is all okay.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

It's snowing now,still on the plane - captain assures us the runway is open and we will be off momentarily. Asks the stewardess for some water to be told I would have to pay (despite EU regulation and Ryanair website explaining after 2 hours they will feed and hydrate passengers). I was told to get food we would have to go to the terminal except they wouldn't and couldn't open the door. 6 hours later the captain promises that help is on its way in the form of a staircase to take us back inside Stansted but still no sign of a staircase (unless you count the one outside the aircraft gathering snow). 6.5 hours later we depart. Finally we are in the air, bewildered and shocked that Ryanair can ask a full plane of customers to sit for over 6 hours without water, without food and without explanation.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

EasyJet pricing is much more transparent and their customer service is substantially better. Ryanair seems like a good deal at first but suffers from obnoxious pricing schemes (randomly allocated seating just makes a huge mess at takeoff and serves no logistical purpose besides coercing you into paying an extra 25 Euro per person to sit next to your family) and absolutely terrible customer service that refuses to directly answer the questions you ask them. First they had a mistake on their website when I booked, causing me to pay for unnecessary priority boarding. At the airport we didn't actually get priority booking because a bus took us to the plane which was full of passengers who didn't pay for priority booking and we boarded after them. When I contacted customer service they refuse to acknowledge the initial mistake so I asked them questions about the new baggage policy which they won't answer directly, but simply copy and paste from the website (I can actually read, thanks). When I explained that I didn't even get the priority boarding that I paid for I get another copy and paste about how they are a non-refundable airline. It's impossible to have a dialogue with the customer service team because there's no way to answer on the same thread that you opened, even when I went through their complicated Contact Us menu, and try to update an existing complaint, the system said that the customer service number I've been given is not valid as it is 7 digits instead of 6. So every email I send them I have to do through a separate complaint in which I need to attach the previous emails as documents.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

This airline doesn't have a very good reputation for service, so expectations were low. But since the route was perfect for me, I still chose it. And I was positively surprised. Having recently flown a major carrier I actually found the Ryanair flight better. Check in is easily done with their mobile app, and it is of course a bit annoying that you have to pay extra to choose your seat. But still a lot better than it used to be when you had to stand in line to get a decent seat. They also have a very good system for cabin luggage. Either you can pay to take it on board, otherwise they only allow a limited number of large cabin bags, the others will be placed in the hold free of charge. This makes boarding much easier, and you can actually find place for your duty free bags and coats in the plane, something that can be almost impossible on other airlines. They now also allow an extra small item, which is far better than they used to be. I was also surprised by the leg room, which was good even for me who is quite tall. Since the seatbacks cannot be reclined you don't end up with someones seatback very close to you. The next surprise was their meal service, where they served good food for low prices. I even manage to find a gluten free meal, which was easy to determine since all items were clearly marked with allergene symbols. The departure was delayed for an hour due to snow in Sweden, and before landing we had to wait more while the runway was cleared from snow. But I found all staff very professional and pleasant. Ryanair used to be an annoying airline with bad passenger service. But while other airlines are constantly deteriorating and copying the low cost airlines I am happy to say that Ryanair is getting better and better. If it wasn't for their annoying habit of seating passengers travelling together apart from each other unless they pay, I would give it a higher mark still.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I have just checked in for our flight. We really don’t care where we sit on the plane but after checkiing in we selected free allocation and were offered window seats 7F, 23A and 31F they could not have been anymore far apart. When we looked at the seat map we found that next to each allocated seat were two free seats - how ridiculous and mean is this. I can’t have our nine year old sitting at the front of the aircraft in 7F next to a total stranger so we had to pay for one adult to sit next to our son. I believed that it was the law that an airline could not split children up from at least one parent. When your travelling with children and booking a ticket with Ryanair you do have to select if your travelling with children. I believed this was to stop the system splitting a child up from at least one of the parents. The child fare is the same price as an adult with Ryanair so why do you have confirm one of the passengers in the booking will be a child? Ryanair this is extremely tacky, and obviously a money spin to earn more money.

I have flown on many different discount airlines, both inside the states and outside mainly in Europe. I've never had a worse travelling experience than with Ryanair. The airline has yet to be on time for flights, and for this trip was delayed both ways significantly. (An hour sitting on the flight to Dublin and already 20 mins to Budapest.) The attendants are rude and unhelpful and do not provide any useful information. For example, telling the cabin the delay is from a attendant who was going home because he's sick instead of the reality that he never showed up, which is what was said earlier. It wasn't that only instance where the staff acted errantly. On the way back to Budapest my fiance and I got belligerently approached by a staff member who demanded to know why our ""Visa Check"" had not been completed and that she didn't have time to check it herself. (Even though we've been waiting in the delayed priority line for the plane for 20 mins). I tried to explain to her that the staff we dropped our luggage off with said we had nothing else to do but go to security. Finally, the website also needs to have a better system of checks when offering other services, like car rental. My fiance and I rented and paid for a car in Dublin, knowing that an extra fee is often charged to people under 25. The site gave no indication that this wasn't taken in account for, or that there was an issue with our rental. When we showed up the company would not give us a car, and did not offer us a way to contact the airline for a refund. We have yet to get a reply from customer service in their limited and costly to call internationally hours.

The DVLA Web site was not available when I attempted to collect the car. So, the car rental required an additional £15.00 in order to use a Premium Help Line and get the passcode. Last, but not least, they asked me to sign a clause granting the rental car company to charge my credit/debit card of any fee, fines, even if I was not present. It appeared to me as to sign a blank cheque. What you pay is what you get from Ryanair. I will stick on booking the airplane seat only for the time being.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Possibly the worst airline customer service. As I checked in the agent handed me back my boarding pass and travel documents but kept my passport by mistake. By the time I realized it was missing, I was at the gate but with 40mins to spare till the flight went. I though a simple phone call to the check in agent would solve the issue. First there was no signs of any Ryanair staff at the gate. Only Swissport agents who could not care less about my issue. I had to insist for them to ring the check in desk. The agent acknowledged they had my passport. However they would not bring it back to me. I had to go get it myself. The gate being the furthest away meant a 20 min run both way. In short there was no way I could exit security and return to the gate on time to catch my flight. I asked them if they could wait for me for a few extra minutes rather than offloading my bags. Their answer was no, and the gate will be closing soon too. Any airline who respect their passengers would have had the passport rushed to the gate on time by one of their staff. Especially so since it was the check in staff fault. As a result I ended up missing my flight and best of all I had to pay a re-booking fee of 100 pounds, even though it was the check in staff fault. I also had to book a room at the airport hotel which cost me another 100 pounds. I did wrote to Ryanair about the issue and other than standards letter of apologies explaining that they can't be held responsible for the agents lack of support they were not prepared to cover any extra cost involved. This is a gross misconduct coming from Ryanair. Ryanair already have a very bad reputation, and this is just adding on to that pile.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

All other airlines are willing to accommodate this kind of extreme situation, except for Ryanair. Poorly managed, terrible customer service, and on top of it all, they make it extremely hard for people to complain (try and look for their Customer Service number).

On October 21st, I received an email claiming that my payment was declined, that my booking has been CANCELLED and that in order to take the flight, I would have to rebook on ryanair.com. A few days ago, I received an email saying that I had to ""check in"" for my flight online, a flight that was supposedly ""cancelled"". I talked to support for almost an hour, and they're still talking to me while I type this review because they're claiming that after the booking was ""cancelled"" they tried my card several more times until it was successful. Now that would have been perfectly fine if I was told that my card was continuously being tried as the payment method; or I was told when my card worked and that I would have been charged the money. In either of those cases I would not have spent more money in order to buy a new ticket from a different airline. Support also claimed that they have ""no cancellation policy"" - which is not even the situation right now. I'm only looking for a refund on the ticket that was presumably ""cancelled"" which still charged my credit card - which they say they ""cannot do anything about"". I know the price is very appealing to people, that's why I decided to give them a chance, however I can say clearly now that they aren't worth it. Spend an extra 50 bucks on a decent airline before wasting your money here.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The flight was on time departing and arrived 10 minutes early. Ground staff and flight crew were all charming. Flight almost full and several cabin bags ended up in the hold, but all passengers affected seemed to be content about the arrangement as they did not have to pay extra. Most noticeable that several passengers also brought more than their cabin bag allowance on board, both in number of bags and in the size of some of them. Some bags removed to the hold were too large for the overhead lockers. I have never yet had any problems with Ryanair, their service or their website. I have always found the website clear and easy to use, and I am not very computer literate. I have used this route with Ryanair ever since it started operating from Stansted to Carcassonne many years ago, and on only two occasions has anything gone wrong, and on both occasions, the weather caused diversion to another local airport. In both cases, busses were laid on within an hour to ferry passengers between the two airports.

You get the feeling like they are strict only about matters that are in Ryanair's interest, such as those that translate into revenues, because the oversize fee wasn't exactly ""lowcost"" - it was almost the same price as the flight. All luggage costs in total were the same as what I paid for the flight, so i paid double. So much for lowcost. I felt ripped off and also felt the underlying greedy vibe of a company that only uses the ""lowcost"" label as a means to market and boost their brand. The only thing low about this company is friendliness, legroom. Also seems like it targets business people with briefcases, or it sets out to favour these, rather than guitarists, surfers etc travelling the world.

We were supposed to fly from Alicante to Kaunas on the 10th of October, but when we arrived to the airport it appeared that our flight was delayed. We waited for ages, then they put us to the plane, where we waited further. Then they returned us back to the airport and said that our flight was canceled due to the strike in France. Not delayed but canceled! Now we only had the option of getting back our money (which was ridiculous, since with this little money we could not possibly buy a flight with another company) or waiting while Ryanair offers us something else. We chose the last variant since we are pensioners and don't have spare money, and we especially chose Ryanair because they offer the lowest prices. We stood in the biggest queue for the whole night! Thank goodness there were 3 of us and we could substitute one another. Throughout the night Ryanair never offered us even a bottle of water! When it was finally our turn to apply for a change of flight, Ryanair offered us a flight for the 18th October! They were only were willing to pay for one night's stay for us (and this chance had already passed since that was the night we spent in the queue). How we were supposed to live until the 18th October in a foreign country apparently did not concern them. Since we needed to go to Kaunas (Lithuania) we finally managed to board a plane going to Poznan (Poland) which was the closest destination to Kaunas and flew with it. I must say that Ryanair behaved so unprofessionally through the whole situation. Not to offer water to the passengers was the last drop really.

How wrong was I, apparently Ryanair have a policy that if you need to re-book the flight, you will get charged or not is not done on the total cost of the flights, but on the individual costings of each flight and compared with the flight you originally booked. So I looked at the flights and yes my flight there was in fact more expensive than the flight there for thew following weekend, then I look at the flight back and the new flight back is £25 more expensive, so I now not only lost £10 on the total cost change going from my original flight to the new flight I have now lost another £25 because I want to change the flight. So Ryanair have now got an extra £30 out of my 10 second mishap, one mistake I shall never make again, I will never fly with Ryanair again. Ryanair are stingy when it comes to releasing cash, they have changed flight times for 3+ flight of mine in the past. Very disappointing, I never write reviews but I had to make an exception, as Ryanair have really let me down.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

My flight was delayed for 3hrs, I was stuck at the airport and waited. By the time I got to my destination, Sofia it was past midnight. Metro has stopped running, the only way to get into the city centre was via taxi. Since I’m a budget traveler, I didn’t want to waste money on the taxi, so I decided to sleep at the airport and wasted the money for the night of hostel I booked. A day or 2 after, I got an email about flight delays, and only just found out that there was an EU law that any flight delays for 3 hrs and more, the customer is entitled to a claim. I immediately submitted the claim. About a week later, Ryanair rejected my claim, saying my delay was under 3 hrs! Well, the flight was delayed 3 hrs exactly, we didn’t board until 3 hrs later, but it could have landed less than 3 hrs later, which I wouldn’t know, because I didn’t check the exact time I landed, it could be about 2hr 50min later than expected in Sofia. Ryanair also said, any flights that are delayed more than 1.5hr, customers are entitled to claim back expenses during the wait at the airport, providing receipts are provided. At the same time, they closed my case. I took this as a complaint, I asked for the exact time it landed in Sofia; asked for the reason of the delay; explained due to the delay, I lost a night at the hostel, and had to explain to them that I had to sleep at the airport; and why no one informed us there would be spending expenses for delays over 1.5hr? When I got a reply from Ryanair, the staff was not even answering any of my questions, he just repeated the same thing as the first person said, told me to submit any receipts. Also that the flight was delayed for less than 3 hrs, so I was entitled to the 3hr+ claim. I tried again, explaining this further, but once again, it was no use. They were not doing anything about it. I just wanted to warn anyone flying around Europe, if there’re any delays, make sure you check the time, and make a record of it if possible. You can always get it from the website afterwards and save a record for it, if you need any claims. If it’s delayed for less than 3 hrs, check the airline’s policy and see what you’re entitled to. Because obviously they would not just tell you the freebies you could be entitled to, to save their cost! Anyway, Ryanair service is bad, all the emails I had with them back and forth, they were terrible. A different staff reply to my email every time, just repeating the same things over and over again, and not answering to my questions. Up until now, I still have no idea what caused the delay, or the exact time the flight landed.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Instead I was sat in the middle and amongst a group of people who didn’t know each other. You get what you pay for.

Later still, the cancellation farrago threw the whole holiday into doubt until Ryanair was forced to publish the lists of flights affected and we learned that our flights were still on. Then the day before we flew we received an email warning of a ban on carrying alcohol into the cabin and telling us what would happen to any alcohol bought in the ""duty-free"" shops. This did not affect us directly as we never buy any ""duty-free"" but we did wonder whether the flight was going to be full of hen and stag parties. By then, any faith we might have had in Ryanair was pretty well dispelled and we had no high hopes of the flights themselves. In the event everything went fairly smoothly. Boarding for the outward flight was handled efficiently by a single agent while the cabin crew were both pleasant and hardworking. The cabin manager, in particular, carried out her duties very responsibly (for example, not starting the safety demonstration until she was sure that she had the attention of practically everyone on board) but with good humour. There was some changing of seats before we departed, but we were only a few minutes late rolling back. We arrived early (cue the awful triumphal blast) after an uneventful journey. For the return flight, boarding was slightly delayed though it did not impact upon our actual departure time. The cabin crew again worked hard but it was difficult to hear any of their announcements, due to the speed with which they were made plus the conversation level within the cabin. The actual flight was equally uneventful and we arrived marginally early, so we had the trumpet blast again, which this time was greeted by ironic cheers. After all the various alarms beforehand, therefore, we made it there and back without any real bother, but my wife and I have still decided that we will do our best to avoid Ryanair in the future. How can you trust a company that changes the rules after you have booked, yet denies it has done so, or cancels flights on a whim and tries to wriggle out of any of the consequences? My overall rating here therefore balances out the pluses of the actual flights against the minuses of the doubts and uncertainties beforehand.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

My partner and myself flew to Dublin for a day out. After going through the booking system online and reading some of the reviews online we were not looking forward to the flight. The booking system is quite obviously setup to seat people as far apart as possible so the priority seating charge can be applied to sit together, this method leaves you with a feeling of being ripped off, a fact born out in most reviews we read. I personally would prefer the £3 to be automatically applied to the fare with an option to be randomly seated for £3 less, this would leave you feeling you had a bargain instead and cut down complaints and as most people prefer to travel together the airline would probably make more from it and everyone would be happy. We recieved 3 reminder emails from ryanair prompting us to check in online and avoid the airport checkin charge which was good. We were pleasantly surprised by the flights, both journeys were on time and even landed ahead of schedule. The planes were clean and looked new and the staff were proffessional and curtious. At dublin after dropping our hire car we underestimated the time it would take to get through security as it was very busy and by the time we got through our gate was closed. After a mad run the full length of terminal 1 we got to the gate 10 minutes before take off with the gate deserted. However after jumping up and down and waving to the pilots who we could see through the windows, he instructed one of the ground crew to come and get us and bring us to the plane, cant thank him enough. We had a pleasant flight back and based on our experience would book with this airline again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Booked with Ryanair despite all the recent bad publicity and were lucky to not have our flights cancelled. Thought we had paid for seats next to each other on the flight out but the transaction mustn't have completed as I ended up in seat 8d and my husband was sat in 32d. Rather a dramatic difference, but then I suppose that is how they rinse you of more money! I'd come to terms with not taking a suitcase for a whopping £80 return, so I had squashed my stuff into a little hand suitcase and was happy with the fact you had no waiting time at the other end for your case. Unfortunately, as we got to the gate to board the plane, I was told my little case was to go into the hold for free as there were now more than 90 passengers with hand luggage! But it didn't get whisked off by a memeber of staff, oh no, I had to carry it down the steps, and put the thing on the suitcase truck myself! Once aboard the plane and once we realised that our seats were at the other end of the plane, I sat down in my seat and crossed my fingers for a good flight out in between all the stag and hen dos shouting to one another as none of them were sat next to each other either! Makes sense that doesn't it! So we set off on time and the cabin crew have to ask 4 times for everyone to shut up while they carry out the safety demonstration. Four times they got ignored! Throughout the flight, the toilet queue was always 10 people deep, the cabin crew were abused left right and centre by the passengers but eventually we landed safely. Peeved that I had to the stand in another queue waiting for my suitcase, having purposely not spend £80 for the pleasure of not having to wait for it, we stood waiting for 10mins to pick it up. The flight home was much quieter, much smoother and minus so many hen and stags. We paid the extra £4.08 for my husband to sit in front of me and someone kindly offered to swap so we could sit together. I was able to take my little case on board and we all made it home in one piece. I am grateful that our flight wasn't cancelled and I appreciate that the unpleasant flight out was due to the passengers and not the staff.

Absolutely horrifically awful. We got some warnings on this airline, and I wish I had heeded them. It's true that they have the best price initially, but they have so many hidden costs it's obscene and I really feel strongly that a reputable airline is the way to go. I will never fly with Ryanair again. The staff member we met to check in was the rudest person I had ever dealt with in customer service - I don't even know how to describe it, the whole interaction left me in a very sour mood - she informed us that because we had not done the online checkin two hours before our flight (we were standing in front her 1 hour and 45 minutes before our flight, without exaggeration), we now had to pay £100 to have her check us in. This was more than both our tickets combined. It was 6:30 in the morning, and we were the only ones there. I couldn't believe it. The next lady we spoke to who was charging us this fee advised that we had 'checked our email wrong' since there should have been a reminder (there wasn't- I went back and checked, even the junk box). The booking email does mention this fee at the end of the page. If this airline wants to save money by limiting staff and doing things online, I support that - but I should have still been able to check in myself then at that time - to cut off the online checkin 2 hours before and charge a ridiculous fee at that time is just shady, wrong and I felt so angry. They already have additional costs for everything - we had paid to check our bags, and we had paid extra for 'priority' seating so our seats were already reserved - so why would we check in??? So angry and disappointed. The worst part is, this airline clearly does not care about what their customers think, and that makes the customer totally powerless to ensure that the service they're receiving is fair, and this case it's not. I hope this airline does not continue to be supported, and I reiterate my strong recommendation to go with another airline.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

This caused me a lot of problems. 3) Badly handled customer care. I contacted them via live chat to solve problem listed under number 2 and I was promptly dismissed. I could email them, I was told. So I did but until now I did not receive any answer.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Significant delays experienced on both legs of our journey - 2 hours on the way out which seriously interfered with our plans, including a very uncomfortable 45 minutes sitting on a packed plane on the runway, and 2.5 hours on the return journey. Updated announcements for both delays were fed out incrementally every 10-15 minutes, when we could clearly see that the plane was still on the tarmac at the other end and had no hope of reaching AMS/ DUB for at least 90 minutes. To top it off, once on board, it was announced that the Captain was ""negotiating with ATC"" but with no success, when in reality the Ryanair aircraft on this route had missed their time slot earlier in the day resulting in each subsequent flight being pushed back. The staff on the return flight looked really weary but were troopers and delivered good service. Aircraft on both legs were untidy with detritus from previous passengers. Thankfully we had paid for priority boarding and seats and so apart from the inconvenience, were somewhat insulated from the full brunt.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

However, planning a last minute trip to Barcelona with other low cost airlines proved tricky due to flight times so I bit the bullet and booked with Ryanair. I shouldn't have worried as I really couldn't fault the airline. My boyfriend and I flew out of Liverpool to Barcelona and home again, with great ease. Boarding was simple, as we downloaded our boarding passes to our phones (as we always do whenever we fly, so much easier!). We didn't have luggage to check in so can't comment on that but sailed through boarding easily and were delayed slightly before take off (20 mins or so) once on the plane but it's August summer holidays so to be expected! Staff were all super friendly and very quick coming round with the food and drinks trolley. Yes the food and drinks are expensive in general, and in comparison to other airlines. However, if you have a massive problem with the prices they charge then bring your own food on or just wait until you reach the airport at the other end to eat. Seats are not super comfortable or luxurious but they're decent enough for a short haul flight, and you get what you pay for. Overall would definitely fly with them again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I really despise the Ryanair’s boardnig procedure – the gate opens before even the airplane finishes its previous rotation. It causes a necessity of waiting in the bus which drives you to the aircraft for a long time (up to 15 mins even on a domestic flight). The cabin was not fresh but despite that, it was quite clean. The flight was smooth and everything went without delay. The thing that made me uncomfortable onboard was the air in the cabin – it smelled as if it was really polluted which made me difficult to breathe. What is more, it seemed like the cabin crew‘s only duty was to sell food/scratchcards/duty free products to the ‘customers‘. They didn’t really care about passenger safety and comfort (some safety announcements were only made in Polish). To conclude, I really appreciate the effort, Ryanair puts in providing low fares and on-time flights but still, they should improve some parts of their service.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

If you play by the rules, and do as they say you get a cheap flight that's usually comfortable and on time. Using Stansted for this, the gate was far away from the terminal which is fine. Having bought priority boarding, I was one of the first to board but somehow that doesn't matter, just be at the front of the regular queue and you'll save a few quid in the process. Only 90 carry on's can be placed in the overhead locker so I asked for mine to be placed in the hold, gate staff are more often than not happy to assist in that matter when they are asked. Bag tag goes on and I left my suitcase with a baggage handler. Onboard the aircraft was with the old Ryanair cabin on one of their oldest Boeing 737-800 although, she didn't look it. The majority of the Ryanair fleet have the older, more padded seats in a 189Y configuration so good if you're a little larger, like myself. The newer in the fleet with the Boeing Sky Interior have the lighter-weight seating which has far less padding but more legspace although I cannot vouch for that. The seat was comfortable and legspace was okay although another inch would of been beneficial for all 6"" of me. Crew attentive as always passing through the cabin twice on this three hour flight providing a refreshments service which I find to be overpriced so buy before hand in the airport where you'll save money. Crew also passed through the cabin with some perfumes, electronic items and the famous Ryanair scratchcard. Onboard was rather warm but the flight was near enough full so that's to be expected. A comfortable crossing. A smooth landing into Sofia and we parked on a remote stand. Bussed to the terminal on a sweltering old bus into Terminal 2, the better of the two terminals. Ryanair being one of the few low cost carriers to use Terminal 2. Passport control was smooth with border police just visually checking my passport while there was a short delay with getting my bag on the carousel. Returning was a similar affair. The gate staff at Sofia look for oversize bags at the gate so please be warned in carrying oversized bags not to the restrictions. They were also checking for oversized second carry on bags too. I asked for my suitcase to be placed in the hold which the obliged. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to a delay with the inbound aircraft; something that does happen from time to time with the last flights of the day with Ryanair. I slept for most of the flight home onboard a full flight. Air-conditioning was on although it was rather warm onboard and I slept comfortably for such a small space. A quick left hand turn onto short finals ensured a smooth landing into London Stansted. Parked on a remote stand again and was bussed on an old London bendy bus to the terminal where my bag was waiting on the carousel. If you do as your told and play by the rules, you will get a cheap flight. Book ahead in advance and it will be cheap too. If wanting to travel with luggage, the daily BA offering from London Heathrow might be a cheaper option when travel to airport costs are included. Yet another happy Ryanair experience which has certainly got better in the last few years.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

A lot of people rubbish Ryanair, but if you follow their requirements you should have a great flight. If you want to be sat next to someone pay for it.

The Ryanair section was unbelievably busy considering it was 3.45am. However, the line of about 300 people was processed efficiently within 20 minutes. Boarded on time and welcomed by very affable crew. Aircraft had new sky interior and seats which make a huge difference. Plane clean too. Departed on time and crew did usual BOB/scratch card/duty free service. Landed on time in Madrid.

Terrible from start to finish. Split up a family of 4. Both ways. With our children both having a spare seat on the way home! The flights were delayed both ways by a total of 3 hours. Priority boarding was longer than normal boarding. We were normal boarding. The plane was too hot, with the air above our heads barely blowing. The seats and floor were dirty, with the seat next to my husband covered in melted chocolate. We were so far apart from each other we couldn't see any other member of our family, even though my children are not yet 18. They are deliberately splitting people up if they refuse to pay the extra to choose seats. So if you leave it to chance you will be guaranteed to sit apart. They never used to do this, so why start now? But please, do not give in or they will win. The staff were heard talking, and they all want to leave and go to other airlines. Heartless, greedy and cheap.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We have flown with the best, Etihad, Cathay, Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. We have also flown with many budget airlines around the world. We can now say we have flown with what must be, the worst airline on earth. We were in the middle of a cruise with no internet. We docked at Ibiza and went for a coffee. Whilst there we got internet access and received an email from Ryanair saying if we didn't check in, we could be charged $50 Euro each. To our disbelif, we tried to check in online but at the final stage, we were kicked out of the website. We tried several times. At that time there was a global virus effecting everywhere and our search engine Google was not allowing us to access many websites. We were in the Ryanair website but could not complete the check-in. We eventually gave up and decided to try later. Our next stop was Palma where we departed the ship. As we did not have internet access, we decided to get to the airport early so we could hopefully complete check-in well before the 2 hour window Ryanair gives. We arrived at Palma airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We waiting in the check-in queue for around 25 minutes. When we finally were called we explained to the check-in lady that we could not check-in as their website wold not let us complete the checkin the day before. She then went out of her way to try and check us in on our mobile phone. She gave us the thumbs up, but then she must have had the same problem. She tried again but could not check us in on our phone. With 8 minutes before the the 2 hour window, she gave up and said sorry you have 8 minutes good luck. We tried but could not check in on time. Then we went back to the check-in counter and the lady gave us a docket to go to the service counter to pay the $100 Euro ($50 x 2). We walked to the service counter and stood in line for another 15 minutes. We paid $100 Euro because we had no option. When we originally booked this flight, we had other options and wow didn't we regret flying this airline. Whilst waiting in the check-in queue and the service counter queue we heard complaint after complaint about the service/procedures. When we boarded the plane, we saw the seats and could not believe our eyes. The tightest seating I have ever seen, including all the Asian airlines. Scattered crumbs, loose hair and rubbish on just about every seat. I brushed the food off our seat and then thought to take a photo. I wished I took the photo before? When you view the seat photo, the yellow is the head rest of the seat in front. This will show how tight the seats are. The plane looked dirty. As we sat down we heard a lady with a British accent discuss the lack of baggage storage. She had a small bag. The Ryanair stewardess said ""bad luck, take your seat"". The lady passenger yelled ""Typical Ryanair"" The photos attached show the condition of the plane. The seating stunk, worn leather. So on top of an extra $100 Euro we flew the longest hour of our lives and were counting the seconds to get off. Thankfully there were no more dramas after we landed. Do not fly this airline. The response from Ryanair was a standard reply and we could tell they did not read our email. Now we can brag about the best airlines and the absolute worst - Ryanair.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20170704_124011_resized-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20170704_124015_resized-1-50x50.jpg","; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20170704_124011_resized-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20170704_124015_resized-1-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20170704_124011_resized-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20170704_124015_resized-1-500x500.jpg","; ","Type Of Traveller

My boyfriend bought me 200 euros worth of Ryanair flight vouchers for my birthday last year. When I tried to use them to purchase a flight, they wouldn't work. I spent hours and a couple of days with customer service trying to get them to work. Over time, flight prices go up, and they were not offering any solutions. They kept blaming my browser, although I had tried it on various computers, phones, and browsers. Ryanair refused to refund the gift vouchers that didn't work and they refused to book the flight for me. Finally, their solution was for me to purchase the flight with my own debit card and then they would refund the money. I did this, and I did not receive a refund until a month later after having to contact them multiple times to get the refund. In the end they did not refund the full price paid with my debit card. The flight I purchased was less than the balance on my gift vouchers, so I should have gotten new vouchers with the remaining balance according to the terms of the gift vouchers. But, the gift vouchers expired during the time it took them to refund my money, so I guess that money is just lost. I have filed a another claim to try to request the full amount be refunded to my debit card and to receive the remaining balance on new gift vouchers, but after the experience I have had with them, I do not expect to ever see it.

Forty-eight hours before the flight I got an email saying that we had to pre-check-in to avoid a 50 Euro additional charge. I used my cell phone to go online and do this, but when I got to the website I went as far as I could with the pre-check-in and thought it was done. I clicked on every button that seemed to advance me to the next part and then came to the end. When we got in line to check in we were told to go to another line where we learned that the pre-check-in never went through, so we had to pay an additional 50 Euros for each ticket. There were also others in the same line who had the same experience. When we finished the trip I wrote to Ryan Air about it and got back a curt letter saying there was nothing wrong with their website, and that they would not reimburse us. I think this is just a super-sneaky way of getting more money out of some customers. So beware!","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They charge for drinks and snacks but it was not a rip off. Flight attendants were polite and presentable. Seating felt a bit cramped but it was a 737. Flight out landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule but the return was delayed 45 minutes at the gate at Rome Ciampino. This is a small busy airport consisting of one terminal and one runway, which I would now try avoid at peak times.

They come across as a low cost airline but they make up for it in as many ways as possible. If you want checked baggage it is an addition a fee of approx €35 each way for a 15kg bag! If you don't have a boarding pass before arriving to the airport they will charge €50 to print each one and their latest trick is to try and get people to pay for their desired seat allocation. If you don't want to pay for your seat allocation they will purposely split you up, myself and my partner were about 10 rows apart on our way to Palermo and back from Dublin. We know there were many others in the same situation including families with children. On my return flight I even had a free seat next to me. Seats don't recline on the planes and there are zero complimentary refreshments including basics like water.

Pretty scruffy aircraft, obviously the late arrival in Poitiers left insufficient time for a thorough clean. Aisle seats are not great given the constant movement of trolleys and the inevitable knocks to arms and legs. Random Seat Allocation - This term is somewhat of a misnomer. The only way it is random is that if you don’t pay to select a seat before travel you will certainly be allocated seats away from others on your booking. BA despite their recent demise usually have the sense to allocate passengers on the same booking adjacent seats. On this flight we were seated just 15 rows apart. From the comments of other passengers and on social media, this really must be considered an ‘own goal’ by the airline. Surely it would be better to increase lead in prices a little and get rid of this ridiculous policy and stop antagonising numerous passengers. Until the last couple of months I had been increasingly impressed by Ryanair’s more customer focussed attempts. In future I will travel with another carrier wherever possible.

This has never happened before when doing check in. Now if we would like to sit next to each other we need to pay £9 for reallocating one of us. I'm shocked how low Ryanair has fallen and with all honesty I can say this is the worst airline I have flown. I was a regular client of theirs but from this day I will definitely switch to easyJet or Wizz Air.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Absolute bargain at 12.98 euros one way. Since I went for the low price I didn't want to add any extras, so no reserved seat. It's irritating how Ryanair keeps pushing you to buy a seat 'or maybe you won't sit together'. On the outbound flight the computer put as together at an A and B-seat but on our way back we were punished for not buying our seats: my wife and I were seperated about 15 rows and put both in a B-seat. Why is a mystery since there were enough seats next to each other and the cabin crew allowed me to join my wife. I would suggest that Ryanair stops this mocking of passengers. Apart from that: a flawless, efficient flight with not too friendly crews, but it gets you form A to B for a really low price,,so in that regard they keep their promise. I even noticed more legroom thans to new seats.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Boarding at Stansted was somewhat shambolic. After queuing at the gate, we were then left standing on the tarmac for about twenty minutes before actually getting on the aircraft. Ryanair’s recent charm offensive seems to have gone in reverse given the way seats are arbitrarily allocated at check in, unless you pay to choose your own. My wife and I were given middle seats in two different rows whilst both the seats adjacent to us were unoccupied. Bizarre!! This situation seemed to apply to many other families resulting in a shambles as many passengers attempted to swop seats in an attempt to sit together. Departure was thirty minutes late, but because of the generous flight times the plane landed in Poitiers just 15 minutes behind schedule. The only redeeming feature of this unedifying experience was the pleasant attitude of the cabin crew.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

The latest money grabbing trick by Ryanair is to seat a couple at the furthest ends of the plane from each other, even when the plane has 90% empty seats, so that if you want to sit together you have to pay to allocate a seat - I have got to say I have been waiting years for them to work this one out - so predictable. This now goes beyond cheeky and is into the realm of despicable behaviour. Seats have always been filled on a first come, first served basis until now, so it is clear that this is done on purpose so as to generate more profit. But do you know what? This profit is not going to be coming from me, as I vow never to fly Ryanair again. I am a very regular flyer who tends to sway towards budget airlines, so EasyJet will be seeing much more business from me in future (unless they try the same filthy trick as Ryanair).","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Apparently this is an extra charge to avoid ""administration"" fees should you return the car partly fuelled. You still have to pay for the used fuel.

I purchased a flight that I immediately tried to check in on. However, I found I'd lost my passport. That's fine, I'd only booked the ticket 20 mins ago, so thought it would be reasonable to get a refund. They don't give one. So I want to change my flight, that's okay within 24 hours. There's a £5 charge anyway, but that's okay. Except that Ryanair won't allow you to upgrade the next flight to match to price of your existing one, forcing you to undercut your ticket price and lose money. Ryanair don't refund this money back to you, won't allow you to use this money as credit on other flights or services and don't allow you to add options to your new flight, like additional baggage, ect. The customer service advisers I spoke to were awful, none of them made any suggestions or offered help, but continually spammed the same response about terms and conditions over and over. So I find that I can fly to Ireland without a Passport anyway, since I'm flying from the UK. I can use my driving license. Except you can't with Ryanair. You can with other airlines, but not Ryanair. So pretty much in every way, Ryanair have made this mistake as costly for me as possible. While I appreciate I made a mistake in that I should have made sure I had my passport to hand before I booked, the inflexibility, none existent customer services and just all around terrible service I received have made me decide to avoid this airline in the future.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Check in was fine as this is done via their app but boarding was late as always and the ground staff predictable indifferent. Once on board the seats were bearable with only a small amount of leg room. If I were over 6ft then it would be uncomfortable. Cabin crew are okay but spend the most part finding places for people's bags as they continually fail to impose size or weight restriction at the gate given the bags people bring on board. The flight was late arriving but nothing to severe and disembarking was a breeze with front ant back doors used.

Using 'Special Assistance' I found the cabin staff on both flights, as usual, very helpful. Outbound was a new 737-800 with the thinner seats and modified wing form which gave slightly more leg room and a quieter flight. An interesting phenomenon of the new wing form was that the vapour trail formed much nearer the trailing edge and was observable from row 28. Outbound was on time but return was delayed 30 minutes due to a combination of Stansted passenger delays and a strong head wind giving a rather lumpy ride on an older aircraft. One thing Ryanair have got right is their choice of red wine which for me is the best of all the low cost airlines.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Our plane was new with their modified slimline seats, which, compared to the older type, improve legroom rapidly and with 185 cm, I felt comfortable. Also the cabin colors on their newer planes are not as agressive as it used to be a couple of years ago, a big improvement. Can't wait to be lucky enough to try the SkyInterior on a Ryanair flight.

The outbound flight was early in the day however was ideal as you got an extra day in Barcelona. Return flight again was ideal, as you got home at a reasonable time. I booked extra leg room seats, 2D was my seat for both flights. With that you got priority boarding. Extra legroom was excellent, I'm 5'11 with back problems and I found this seat comfy and could straighten my leg out full with passengers who sit in 2D/E can get past me without hassling me. So I recommend anyone flying with RyanAir to do this! I would like a bit more cushion for your bottom. Priority boarding is good, as you don't wait in the normal queue, however its annoying when you are boarded first, and everyone is trying to get past you to get to their seat, and are hitting you with their bags etc. However great for you when you land, you are off first. One thing on the baggage, is on the Ryanair website they sound like they are strict with the baggage allowance. I noticed many people having 'bigger' bags getting on the plane okay, no questions asked. Thought that was a bit unfair considering I had cabin bag size. Mobile boarding, love it! However I would like Ryanair to do what easyJet do, and alert you of the gate via your phone. Anyway, I would fly again with Ryanair, always on time, never late, cheap, and very good!!

I would never had booked this journey without getting a similar fare. It makes all the difference. Now it's time to see what could be improved. Ground handling: below the standards. The incoming flight was delayed, so they decided to start boarding when the plane arrived at the stand. That added more delay and resulted in a slot loss and in a 30-minute-delayed departure, that could problably had been partially avoided with a better coordination. The flight time was shorter than scheduled, so that we catched up the delay and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule. The onboard experience was good and being asked to move to a vacant seat in the emergency exit row gave some rest to my long legs. Awesome, isn't it? Negative score to the bar service: the food products we selected were unavailable and that was a pity. I don't mind having a snack or to dine on board instead of doing it at the airport, but with no guarantees about the products available, I'll start to consider the airport bars when flying with Ryanair.

I fly with Ryanair very often, due to studying abroad. I find the airline is good value for money. I do find travelling longer distances can feel a little cramped, which yesterday was definitely the case - it was a very full flight and I felt claustrophobic at the window seat with my bag at my feet, coat on my lap, and two female passengers to my right. Usually I get over the claustrophobic feeling, but this time the heating on the plane was very over-powering and it got so warm I started to feel sick, dizzy and faint. The cabin staff and the head air hostess on duty were professional and had a rapid response to me which I am so grateful for. If it wasn't for them, I would have passed out or thrown up, or both. They removed people immediately from my row so I could lie down and elevate my legs. I was offered tea and sugar and a member of the cabin staff sat with me until the colour came back into my face and I felt normal again. A big thanks to all the cabin staff (FR1023 on 7th January) for being so efficient and kind. I really appreciated it.

We were then made to queue outside for 20 minutes until the aircraft was ready - bearing in mind it's January and we're in Scotland, it was freezing. Once I boarded the aircraft one of the flight attendants commented on how cold my hands were which was bizarre as the only reason I was that cold was due to the airline that they were representing. The flight also almost ran out of food and they flight attendants couldn't of cared less, it felt like they just wanted to finish their shift and get home. We missed our departure slot at Edinburgh which was slightly frustrating as we were standing in the cold outside the aircraft for so long - but the informative Captain got us there only 5 minutes later than scheduled! It made me laugh however when they thanked us for choosing Ryanair because in actual fact, we did not have a choice for our dates of travel. Overall I just did not feel as well looked after as I continually do on their rivals easyJet.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I was flying with them last week from Malaga to Palma de Mallorca, after many years avoiding them. I'm not criticizing this company, but it is obvious that is a low cost company without any kind of comfort for the customer. I have experienced long lines in order to access the plane and have a place to store your luggage - it doesn't matter if you have assigned seat. Passengers have to stand more than 45 minutes before the call to board, and even after this they made us to wait other 30 minutes before entry to the plane. Once inside there is a big rush of people trying to put their luggage in rack without any consideration for the next passenger. Staff quite overtaken by this and during the flight only bother to sell food, drinks, lottery tickets and perfume. Our flight had 1 hour delay. Seats are quite uncomfortable. All in all, they transfer you from A to B in the most basic fashion.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Since I work as a travel agent I knew of all the ""hidden"" fees and everything you need to do prior to your arrival at the airport, so check-in etc went very smooth. We chose to purchase the priority boarding queue which turned out to be totally worth it, we had lots of room while we were in line since most people used the regular line, which was very comfortable. We boarded a little late, which we we prepared for so no harm there and once we got on the aircraft the cabin crew were very friendly and even funny. The security briefing went by very fast though. Take-off and landing we're both rather quick and steep, which is not what we're used to but still, nothing to really complain about.

All flights were on time with professional and friendly service both on the ground and in the air apart from the ground service in Athens. I usually pay for priority boarding because it guarantees I keep my hand luggage on board and above my seat which means a quicker and easier exit from the plane. Boarding in Athens was chaos. A passenger asked why the priority boarding procedure was not being followed and the reply from the ground staff was: ""nobody understands how it works"". Meanwhile at the next gate, the correct boarding procedure was followed without a hitch. On our return I wrote to Ryanair just to let them know what had happened and explained that I knew it was not their fault, but was the fault of the handling agents in Athens, I received an immediate reply advising that the extra I had paid for priority boarding would be refunded to me. I have now received that refund. Full marks to Ryanair whilst my fight for a refund with a large national carrier for something which was entirely their fault has been ignored for almost 12 months now.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The aircraft are clean. The flights are on time and the prices are ridiculously cheap. You can get Edinburgh to London single from £9.99 if you book early. I find the staff on board tend to be very pleasant and helpful. The seat is fine, it is certainly not the most comfortable ever but given that they only do short flights this is fine. The only slight annoyance is that there is no seatback pocket to put anything in. Overall I would recommend them highly, I think that the value is much better than BA. Ryanair do not charge for a credit card payment, BA charge £5. Ryanair are more frequently on time in my experience, and the prices are often around 1/8 of BA prices. No contest I would choose Ryanair. Stansted as an airport is fine, the security was better before they meddled with it, the staff can be rude, but this is the same for anywhere, the main problem is that other passengers at Stansted are just awful, but once you've been a few times you find the quiet seating areas away from everyone else. Ryanair is a good experience, especially for the price. To sum up it does what it says on the tin. To those reviewers complaining about being charges to check in, this is commonplace now, read the instructions before you book and you'll be fine, its not Ryanair's fault.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

The outward flight was punctual and I had an empty seat beside me - always useful as you can twist sideways and gain a little extra comfort. The inflight service was poor. As seats on Ryanair do not have pockets, the price list in contained in their magazine. On this occasion, none was offered. Instead, cabin crew simply started selling. I asked for the list and was astonished to find the prices expressed in euros. When I questioned this, the steward told me that this was because Ryanair was an Irish airline. When I asked what the conversion rate to sterling was, I was told it was roughly the same. Crews are now equipped with handheld calculators. I was 'allowed' to pay in sterling, but, when I asked what the exchange rate was, was simply told 'Ryanair's own'. So, to sum up: lack of transparent/any visible pricing, exorbitant on-board prices - and not even a half-melted ice cube in sight! Why can't the CAA set some basic standards and sort Ryanair out once and for all? We know the fares are cheap, but that shouldn't be an excuse for trying to bamboozle people. And certainly a price cap is needed for printing boarding passes at the airport. The flight back was in complete contrast: well-dressed cabin crew, girls made up immaculately, good piloting and on-time landing. Needless to say, this time I didn't try to buy anything on board. Flight only marred by screaming babies for the first half hour and again on the descent. Yes, you can encounter a poorer type of parent on Ryanair, as well as on many others!","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

After years of reading bad reviews and articles about Ryanair I was very hesitant to fly with them. However, I decided to try them when I found a very low price to my destination, and also because a friend told me they'd improved their customer services considerably. The on-line booking and purchase were simple and straight forward. I received several follow-up e-mails reminding of any additional services I might like to add. Check-in at Berlin Schoenefeld was fast and there was no line. Boarding on-time. Although my carry-on day pack was probably a bit larger and heavier than the rules permit, no one looked at my hand luggage or hassled me about it. I had paid for priority boarding, which worked well. There was separate priority line and we were allowed to board first. The plane was clean, the seat reasonably comfortable, and the service was friendly and efficient. I noticed none of the excessive announcements or heavy selling that I'd read about. Take off and landings were on time. The return flight from Vilnius was equally good and without problem. I was pleasantly surprised by Ryanair and would certainly fly them again. They seem to have turned over a new leaf.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I have to give a thumbs up for the ground crew, the flight was delayed for about 1h and they came and told everybody and apologised for it personally and not simply with an announcement, a lot of traditional flag carriers should learn from this. Boarding was fast and we departed late but not as late as we were expecting. The airplane was clean. The crew was very friendly, smiling all the time. Not sure if this happens every time but whenever I travel in the last flight of the day with Ryanair, the crew seems to be much more friendly and playful, with a light mood and doing some nice jokes to cheer the passengers. On board sales service was well provided and prices were affordable. Once again, the crew was very effective and helpful with passengers buying items as I did. Flight was very quiet, with zero turbulence (which is rare in a flight to the Azores) and although we arrived with a delay, we manage to recover some of that 1h delay, arriving with something like 30 to 40 minutes late. Unboarding was very fast and crew was friendly saying goodbye to the passengers.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Time is one of the most important factors when I travel and I have targets to achieve and I am pleased to say that Ryanair played a relevant role to allow me to be efficient. Arriving around 25 minutes ahead the schedule gave me the chance to do what I was supposed to do earlier and it definetely simplified my day program and also gave me some (extra) free time. If I have to choose between paying more for additional service or to receive a smart, no frills service, I have no doubts: Ryanair will be my choice. When I booked this flight (4 days before departure) a direct flight (with more or less the same schedule) from another airline was about three times the price. The fare was not a ""low-cost"" fare but it was the cheapest and most competitive one.

The plane was new, with redesigned interiors, softer colours and LED lighting. As I am about 1.90 m tall, legroom is very important for me and I felt satisfied with my seat, as I had enough space to stretch my legs. The cabin crew were nice, welcoming and funny, so the flight was pleasant except for the commercial announcements that were very frequent during the journey. The flight was very cheap (around 20 Euros), so onboard sells are a source of profits for the airline.

Ryanair was what I expected: bare-bones, a la carte, transportation from Point-A to Point-B. To that end, it was fine. I bought priority boarding, priority security (Fast Track) and priority seat assignments. That made the experience tolerable. However, Stansted Airport was a disaster, and I would never again fly out of there. Add to the unbelievably large Duty Free Area the fact that a gate is not assigned until about 40 minutes prior to departure. That is unforgivable - that leaves scant little time to get to that gate. In our case, the single escalator leading up to the Gate 40-59 waiting area was out of service, so 180 passengers per flight times 19 gates meant over 3400 people were trying to ascend a single staircase. The obvious fire-hazard aside, it meant a crush of humanity in the passageway and an exceptionally long transit time from the hub to the gate. The only reason I can see for this is to keep the passengers in the shopping/dining area as long as possible. Rome Ciampino, on the other hand, is a dump, but quickly navigated. If I could fly them without transiting Stansted, I would consider it.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ryanair-STN-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ryanair-STN-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ryanair-STN-500x500.jpg","","Aircraft

Absolutely one of the worst airlines on the planet. Don't be fooled by the initial cheap fares. They add charges for everything: printing your ticket, baggage check-in, meals, drinks, choosing your seat etc. Traveling around I did not have access to a printer. At the airport they charged me 15 Euro just to print the boarding pass, which I had to do myself. So that is charging me 15 Euro for me to touch their screen a few times and use a small piece of their paper? This, and everything else, is pure extortion. Even on the flight you are constantly harassed to buy things. There is no doubt that you are seen as a money-making opportunity and not as a person or valued client. The crew are friendly, but not the ground staff and their system is cumbersome and disorganised. I vow never to fly Ryanair again. I'd rather pay a higher fare with another airline and get good service which in the end is not much more expensive anyway when one considers all the additional charges.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We were 30 minutes late leaving the gate at Stansted because 2 families who had not booked seats in advance were not happy with being separated. Quite rightly people who had booked would not move so they had to take the seats given. If you book in advance it saves problems on the day. On return we were again 30 minutes late due to late arrival of aircraft. This time we had a child on board who screamed for most of the journey, not Ryanair's fault. We made no purchases. The non reclining seats give enough leg room.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Just come off a particularly unpleasant Ryanair flight where for the entire 1 hour and 20 minutes my wife and I were subjected to an all pervading smell of vomit. When initially challenged the cabin crew claimed to know nothing about this although we were offered a move to the row of sets in front of us (which was empty despite an otherwise full flight) and from whence the smell seemed to be emanating. Interestingly when we raised the issue of the foul smell with a different member of crew, on leaving the plane we were told that we had been offered a move and that there was a limited amount they could do to clean up vomit so despite the initial denial of knowledge the crew were well aware of the unpleasant conditions in which we had been expected to travel. I am well aware that Ryanair is a budget airline and am generally happy to accept that but do think they need to adhere to basic levels of cleanliness and be honest with passengers which sadly wasn't the case today.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We took the business plus option and, while more expensive, it was certainly cheaper than any other option on any route to the same area. We were certainly happy with the service through Edinburgh airport, although there didn't appear to be a dedicated business plus desk available, but the fast track through security and the early boarding were very welcome. Flight departure was scheduled for 6.55am and by 6.25 we were standing outside the airport buildings at the head of a long queue waiting for boarding. This is probably the worst part of flying with Ryanair and such as passengers may be exposed to the elements for quite some time waiting to board, thankfully on this particular morning it was dry, not too cold and bearable. The crew appeared about 6.30 and by 6.40 we were in our seats watching the oncoming passengers in what appeared to be a full load struggling to find overhead locker space and, some their seats. Departure was delayed by half an hour for air traffic control purposes but, once airborne everything went very smoothly and I managed to catch up with some sleep on the way. Cabin crew were friendly, informative and appeared to meet all the needs expected of them by passengers. The return trip was somewhat similar although check-in in Santander was through normal processes, i.e. we all queued up for two desks and took our turn with everybody else to check-in our bags, there was no special service for business plus but that was not a problem as the staff at the desks were quite efficient. Again, the wait outside for boarding, this time in nice sunshine, aboard in plenty of time and airborne exactly on schedule. A newer aircraft this time with the more modern Boeing cabin lighting etc. Good service from the crew and this time we availed ourselves of the excellent coffee and a croissant at an acceptable price. Flight was very smooth and arrival in Edinburgh some fifteen minutes early. Quite impressed with the ""modern"" Ryanair approach and we would be very happy to use them again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

No apology, no explanation, nothing. Some 30 minutes later we were boarded onto a different plane which stood on the tarmac for at least another 45 minutes waiting for refueling. Apparently, the first aircraft had too much fuel on board and the second not enough. Adding insult to injury our vegetarian panini was full of bacon and the replacement we were given after complaint was best before September 2016. Again no apology from the surly hostess who threw 5 euro at us when we showed her the date of expiration had passed.

We were not provided any proper instructions or checks and we waited a considerable amount of time, for just one bus to arrive and then it was a free for all to get on the bus. Some time later another two buses arrived and we were driven to Alicante airport. We had to go through security yet again and the flight eventually took off at 12.40am.

The quality of service received was what we expected. We paid bucket shop prices and got bucket shop service, so no surprises there. The company mantra has always been 'you get what you pay for, so don't moan'. However, my complaint is about the way Ryanair treats its customers in that they don't provide accurate information (in most cases, no information) on delays, corral them like cattle and make them wait for very long periods outside in the rain (return flight from Murcia) with no regard for our well being. Ryanair has been a very successful airline mainly because of ticket price, but as the number of people travelling abroad is slowing down they may want to pay a little more attention to customer care if they want to maintain or improve market share. Price is now no longer enough.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Regular traveller with Ryanair, not so much by choice but they are only airline going to Stansted which is near where I work. I have found nothing different about Ryanair since their effort to be more friendly according to their ads. The staff on the plane are generally unhelpful and unfriendly, the staff on the ground are the same and you can add ""look disinterested"". I have been a regular traveller for 18 years and I will try to be impartial so I must say they are generally on time. Apart from that one fact which is important they are a disaster as a service and god help you if anything goes wrong ie lose your ticket, passport etc or have a query. You will be referred to the website by the person on the ground and when you get on there you can talk to an agent on their webchat. I have done this a number of times and nothing ever gets resolved, you go round and round in circles. I recently had my passport stolen and did not realise this until I got to the airport. I saw the Ryanair help desk and it was like talking to a brick wall - no facial expression, not a care or desire to help. I had my Irish driving licence with photo id and my address on the card, but they said it needs to be a passport which they know I had stolen. I said you can check on my Ryanair account which shows clearly when logged in I had 4 other flights booked in the next 2 months plus the previous 100 taken in last 2 years, again just a sigh and no help. I feel that the staff really do need to be recruited better and trained to help and find a way to express themselves. You do not even need a passort to fly from UK to Ireland so what was the problem? I ended up catching an Aer Lingus flight back from Heathrow to Cork and what a treat that was - a far cry from Ryanair in every detail such a professional outfit. I tried again to contact Ryanair when back for my next flight to UK, but their chat line / phone and email (to which I had no response) was unsatisfactory and no help whatsoever.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Like a previous reviewer I too used 'passenger assistance' through Ryanair. The airline do not provide this but arrange it through the airport and whilst at Bristol the service was truly appalling (see my airport review), the service at Faro was excellent. The cabin crew were very helpful in assisting with loading luggage into the overhead bins and helping me to the front of the aircraft at Faro to await the 'lift'. It is not fair to blame an airline for poor airport service.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I am writing a review on behalf of my partially sighted 76 year old mother, who flew alone on flight FR9943 from Cork to Lanzarote on the 8th of Sept. 2016 to meet other family members who were already holidaying there. My mother who also suffers from a chronic back problem can not walk quickly, nor can she walk long distances requested wheelchair assistance and a person to walk her on to the aircraft to find her seat as she is incapable of reading seat numbers due to her sight. All this information is clearly stated on the boarding pass. EASY, SIMPLE, wouldn't you think, not so for Ryanair, my mother was wheeled to the departure gate area and left there. Eventually after a period of time she managed to make her own way to the departure desk to inquire what was going on. The person there literally man handled my mother and ran her down the gangway onto the aircraft dropped her luggage on to a seat and left just as the flight was about to leave. There was not one member of cabin crew helped my mother, other passengers on the flight helped her to find her seat, she put her luggage on the floor as she would be totally unable to put it in the overhead locker. As any traveller would image, a very uncomfortable 4 hour flight with luggage taking up the small space where your feet should be. On arrival at Lanzarote, she and another passenger with need of assistance were left waiting at the exit door of the aircraft for a very long time (I don't know exactly how long but it was certainly long enough for family to start worrying and try to find her, afraid that they had somehow miss her). My mother was so upset with all she went through, that she could not, even 2 days into her holiday relax and enjoy herself. Her flight home was changed (by family, an added unexpected expense) to a different airline, only then did she begin to enjoy herself. Ryanair, shame on you.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I had never flown with Ryanair before, and was not expecting much with it being a low-cost airline. Entering the terminal (Manchester T3) we were annoyed to see that Ryanair checks in all their flights at the same counters, and that there was a huge queue, stretching all the way to the cafés nearby. We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for €3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile. After landing in Barcelona we had to wait 25 minutes for our bags to arrive. On the way back to Manchester two weeks later we were cautious and arrived at the airport 2h 30m before the flight instead, but check in and security were very fast and we spent nearly 2 hours in departures, and with big glass windows this was great for me, being an avid plane spotter. The gate was surprisingly in arrivals, and therefore we had to go through security again to get to the plane. After waiting for 20 minutes to board we, along with everyone else were directed towards arrivals, rather than towards the plane, which ended up in a big confusion for the airport staff. Like on the way, the attendants were attentive and kind and although we had major problems with ground staff the airline is very good value for money, and I would recommend it for those who do not have much money to spend on their flight, although if there is a flight with a different airline with a similar price, I'd pick the other.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The plane was still unloading passengers shortly before 11am so a delay was inevitable. Once the plane had been loaded we were advised by the captain that we had missed the slot and would have to wait for another. We sat on the tarmac for a further hour without a single follow up message from the pilot. We never heard again from the pilots at all throughout the entire journey even once we had landed. At East Midlands, the doors were opened and we were then advised that no ground-crew were available to unload the plane so we again waited on the tarmac for a further 10 minutes. No point Ryainair blaming the ground crew like they did, the reality is that the flight arrived late at Mallorca and therefore late to East Midlands so should put the blame on themselves. I get that delays will occur from time to time, but to not even get an apology for the delays is ridiculous.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I'm happy with Ryanair's budget approach, but over many years of using their flights there's been a consistent changing of goal posts that inevitably disadvantages the customer. These do not seem to be writ large all over their website. My latest encounter involved printing boarding passes. I do both the mobile and the printed- belt n braces kind of approach. I was printing the passes from saved pdf files which displayed all images and the barcode perfectly. The boarding passes printed beautifully except for the barcodes. I altered every possible parameter on the printer, even printing as a super-fine image, with the same outcome ie perfect adverts, lovely table for the barcode info, crisp text, but the barcode a grayed-out blur or totally absent. I went online to their 'chat' - 'well i don't know change your printer' : I phoned customer service - 'use a different browser' - nobody else boarding that flight has had this problem so it's your fault'. Being an OCD sort I actually scrutinised the pretty-looking boarding pass I printed. Unlike earlier iterations, the barcode is now a smaller element of a foldable page stacked with big, colourful adverts. Many users may glance at this and not notice that the barcode is wonky or absent. Most customers will now, I guess, be using the mobile app. Which means that it looks like Ryanair have spotted a niche market represented by the digital divide - ie, if you aren't technically aware, and don't own a smartphone, you'll get 'fined' at check-in. Be interesting to see if any other customers have also experienced this. It interests me that in neither of my encounters with customer advice did the operative advise me to use the mobile app instead - which is the logical answer. In both encounters it was the usual Ryanair indifference plus assigning blame to 'stupid customers'.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We had already taken the time out of our holiday to check-in online for our return flight and print off our boarding passes. But we had 1 hold bag to drop off which we assumed would be a simple bag drop at the airport. We were wrong. We had to queue for an hour to check this bag in as there were only 2 desks checking in all Ryanair flights at the airport. We should not have had to queue at the check in desk to drop a bag when we had already completed our online check in. To our horror, we then had to queue for another hour to drop the bag as the airport doesn't take your bag from the check in desk to the plane on the usual belts (but that's not the airline's fault). There were two further queues at the gate to board the plane. With all the time wasted we had no time left to get our evening meal (we had allowed a generous 3 hours before our flight but it was not enough time). So we were relying on the cabin food once onboard. But they had run out of everything. Only a few pain au chocolat, crisps and coffees were left to share around all passengers onboard. I felt as though we weren't paying customers but instead should be grateful for the disgraceful service we did receive. It was an incredibly stressful experience and I will not fly with this airline again if I can help it.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I had to drop my trolley at the aircraft due to full cabin which was a bit annoying. Since you have seats assigned boarding is absolutely comparable to any other airline. Once in the cabin you need to get used to the strong colors. The seats are absolutely sufficient for the 1,5 hours to STN. Announcements had been in clear and understandable English. Take-off was on-time and the flight to STN was absolutely smooth with a safe landing in STN. As usual there is service against charge onboard as well as Duty Free. After landing the baggage was available at the baggage claim immediately and we left STN approx. 25 minutes after landing. Flight back to NUE was comparable.

I have flown on this route about 6 times this year and have consistently been very satisfied with Ryanair. There are 3 other budget airlines which I could choose but Ryanair's fares are always the cheapest. They allow a cabin bag plus another small bag (e.g. laptop), which is generous for a budget airline. They boast about a 90% on time arrival (within an hour), and given my experiences I can believe it. I have been delayed once and that was because all flights were grounded due to weather. The staff are fine, friendly enough. Boarding can be a bit chaotic, and I would recommend paying the small fee for priority boarding (note that this does sell out, so do it at time of booking rather than a later add-on). Personally I don't care about in-flight entertainment, magazines, or drink services, so I won't make any judgement based on those (which is good, because they are either non-existent, or average at best). If you want a good trip here is what to bear in mind. Have expectations that match the price - this is a budget airline that tries to deliver best price by having no-frills. Read the rules and stick to them. Cabin bag dimensions are a bit smaller than usual which can catch you out. Only 20cm width as opposed to normal 25cm. Would have caught me out once but fortunately they didn't check bags at the gate. Be sure to check in online prior to arriving at the airport. They do not have check in desks, and if you haven't checked in you are setting yourself up for a hefty penalty. Only the first 90 bags will be boarded, the rest will be put into the hold free of charge. This means that if you insist on carrying your bag, you will have to queue up at the gate to make sure you are one of the earlier passengers to board. If you sit down and wait, go for a coffee or whatever, and then board later, you are not taking your bag on board. The only thing I wish they would change is to remove the bright yellow colour scheme from the cabin. Maybe it's branding, but it just lends a tackiness to the whole experience that seems unnecessary. I am sure they could adjust their brand to something slightly more tasteful. Overall I have to give them top marks. I am not sure they are the best choice for families with small children, but if you're a single traveller or a non-fussy couple/group, and you want to get from A to B cheaply, you won't beat them (on this route, at least).","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I knew Ryanair was a budget airline and to watch for the extras. I had no problem with the booking and even though we didn't pre-select our seats for a fee, when we checked in on-line, we were assigned seats together anyway, on both flights. Check-in at Dublin was chaotic. We had no way to print our boarding passes and they were not downloadable. Not knowing there was a place to print them at the airport, we were reprimanded by the attendant at the bag drop but she printed them for us anyway. The boarding on both flights was somewhat chaotic. Again, we didn't bother to pay for priority boarding (why bother); but one of the flights didn't even have a plane at the gate, and we were herded like sheep into waiting buses which drove out on the tarmac to a waiting plane. Both flights were boarded out on the tarmac, climbing stairs to the plane. The FA's were all friendly enough but the head FA's making the announcements were difficult to understand (they weren't Irish). The flight from London Gatwick was delayed but no fault of the airline; it was due to heavy air traffic (and they only have one runway for both incoming and outgoing flights). The landing at Glasgow was probably the hardest/worst I have ever felt. Overall I would give Ryanair a passing grade for short flights.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I flew from Dublin to Malaga, and returned via Liverpool (Saved bout 90 Euro a head) The flight was the usual. This was the older cabin, not the new one. The seats were okay, leg room is what you would expect from a budget airline. The staff were friendly, and helpful - better than other budget airlines I have flown with. Checked luggage no bother, they even took one of our carry on for free at check in - happy days. The boarding was efficient, jammed up a bit once we were on the plane, but otherwise it was fine. They took another carry on bag from us at the gate. We pushed back on time, and were airborne shortly after. I indulged in some nuts and a coke. And had brought a bite with me from the airport, so that was my main meal. The selection on board is good but pricey. To my dismay, they no longer have the Trip magazines that they had had on my previous flights. The crew were very attentive. We arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule which was great. We disembarked and got our luggage no bother. I would put them way ahead of every other European budget carrier, and maybe even ahead of a few other mainline airlines. My return flight was a mirror of this, although a 4 hour lay over in Liverpool, same nuts and coke and the same window seat.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/spain-ryanair-wing-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/spain-ryanair-wing-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/spain-ryanair-wing-500x500.jpg","","Aircraft

Take note of checking in online prior to your flight else you have to pay an arm an leg to get your boarding pass printed at the check in counter, which was expected of a normal airline check in. To make the situation worse, the 45 euro / pax penalty was not stated during the purchasing process or on our etickets. After queuing for almost an hour at the check in line of Ryanair, we were slapped in the face by an impatient check in officer who just rolled her eyes and said that 'sorry the online check in just ckosed 2mins ago'. And rudely shooed us to the other counter to make payment as she hurried to attend another customer. She said no payment, no boarding, and just shrugged her shoulders. To rub salt in the wound, We were told we could have checked in while waiting in the queue. How would we have known when there was no signage whatsoever while we were queuing. At the 'payment counter' there was another 20 mins queue with more than 30 other passengers paying their penalty. What a great way to easily earn a few thousand extra euro per flight. Anyone who travels will agree that wifi can be inconsistent and even unavailable for a period in a foreign country. After boarding, flight was dirty with food bits and paper on the cabin floor. One of the worst flight experience in my 20 years of flying.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I'm sure this is due to the 2 hour delay for boarding and turn around time. Captain made PA-regulation/restrictions would not allow us to push back for 45 minutes (crew laughed at this PA). This seems like more than enough time to clean a plane. Female crew in the aft of the plane giggling through their safety demos, looking behind at the other female crew and making jokes. A lady pressed the call bell and I could see the crew ignoring it and eating crisps instead. What if it's a medical emergency? When she finally came to check she was still chewing. Crew were running through the cabin, with scratch cards laughing at 1am. No hot food, no tea available. The crew found this hilarious and kept laughing when people complained. It took 1 hour+ to get to row 25 with a drinks cart. The crew kept using the call bells during service even though people wanted to sleep. One female crew could not even form a sentence toward the end of the flight. During all her landing PAs she was laughing. She had to stop and start two safety PAs because she could not stop laughing. All the crew were having a fantastic evening. The customers however, after 3 hour delay and terrible customer service were not. Then as we left the plane the crew didn't even look up or smile.

Two of my most pleasant flights with Ryanair. It's amazing how much the airline's customer service has improved in recent years, particularly with their allocated seating, extra cabin baggage allowance, use of primary airports and excellent mobile app, features, all of which, have significantly enhanced the overall travel experience. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Ryanair have begun using satellite 2 in Stansted for some of their flights, which offers a far more relaxed boarding experience, along with much more space and seating compared to satellite 3 (which is the main gate area from which Ryanair flights operate). Ryanair should definitely consider making more use of this facility, as it is very underused and often empty for long periods of the day. (In fact, there were only 3 flights operating from there when we flew out). Onboard, I noticed that service has improved too, and there are no longer as many tedious announcements as before, particularly on evening flights. On both flights, cabin crew were very friendly and professional. Clearly, Ryanair have come a long way since their improvement plan started, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again. The only thing they could improve on now is to make use of other gate areas that are not so cramped/small, especially in STN.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The coffee grinds come though the filter and stick in your teeth, and the milk is the now the obligatory insipid semi skimmed culminating in the most awful coffee i have ever tasted. The attendant changed it for tea - undrinkable - back to the attendant who was very apologetic and commented that WE should write and complain as he had had several complaints.

My last flight from the UK to Germany only cost £20 return, an absolute bargain. The customer service too has seen a massive improvement over recent years with allocated seating, increased baggage allowance and a refreshed look with the new crew uniforms and cabin interiors. The cabin crew on my last flight were both friendly and welcoming and seemed to engage well with the passengers. The food and drinks on-board are pretty expensive as you'd imagine although on occasions have been cheaper than that offered in some of the airports I've been to, mainly in southern Europe it would seem. The only annoyance, especially when travelling without checked-in bags, is if the ground crew tag your cabin bag to go in the hold due space limitations, although on my last couple of flights the haven't done this and the crew were very accommodating in getting everyone's bags in the overhead lockers. Streets ahead of easyJet now as far as I'm concerned and overall a fantastic airline which I'm sure will continue to use regularly.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

This was bad enough but the return journey was worse - we boarded the plane about 5 minutes before the scheduled departure time and eventually departed over an hour late, no apology or explanation as to why. The consequence was that we were 2 hours late returning to Dublin and missed our pre-booked transport to Cork and had to wait an hour for another connection.

Booked the return flight separately as paying in euros saved money, even using my credit card. Had problems trying to check in online as our computer does not seem to like the new Ryanair website and in the end could only do so via the old so-called Legacy website, only to discover that airport security and boarding gates struggle to read the boarding codes. Outward flight was fine and everyone seemed to get their hand luggage on board despite the flight being full. The return journey was less satisfactory. It was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology given. Boarding at Malaga was in 3 groups: priority first, then rows 22 - 33, then everyone else. We could see that it made sense to board the back rows first when using an airbridge, but some prior warning would have been helpful as the existence of the display notices indicates that it is Ryanair policy. Then as the rest of us were boarded, the boarding agents immediately began to tag our cabin baggage for free hold storage without any warning, which necessitated extracting items wanted on board as we waited beyond the gate. It seemed that there must have been a pre-determined number of passengers to be selected for hand luggage removal as those at the back of the queue were allowed to keep their bags. In fact, as there was a large school party on board with minimal hand luggage, there would have been plenty of room for everyone's bags. We couldn't help feeling unfairly treated as we were near the front in the original queue, but relegated towards the rear and then selected for baggage extraction as well. The flight itself was ok, though we do find Ryanair seats rather numbing after a couple of hours. Those who ordered food, however, were very discontented as it took so long to appear - some did not get theirs till the descent into Liverpool had already begun.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Overall a satisfactory performance. Flights both ways were on time and the sectors were short. Cabin crew very interested in selling you things and were rushed off their feet from take off to landing but were nevertheless professional and welcoming. The seats literally felt like cardboard and were squeezed in together, however from a cost saving point of view and fast turn around times I can understand this especially on a short sector. I would recommend Ryanair as an airline that does simply what it says on the tin no more and no less.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Flight back again was smooth and again fantastic crew especially one crew member who gave a speech at the start of the journey stating that they hardly had any alcohol left but to make up for it they would take is to the Bahamas instead of Prestwick all in good humour. Only downside was the head steward who could have done with smiling a bit more and putting more effort in with customers like his staff.

Lines at both airports were quite bearable - up to 8 minutes each time. Onboard service was polite and professional. I wouldn't call these flights ""pleasure"", but there was nothing irritating. If you carefully read all the rules, you have no trouble. Boarding in Madrid was via finger, boarding in Porto was typical low cost outdoor queuing and lining. In rainy weather it wouldn't work well.

Problem lays squarely with the handling at Manchester Airport as they are simply dreadful (Swissport). Flew Dublin to Manchester. Flew back on EI-EVO, which was clean and tidy with plenty of legroom (however not as much as the newer aircraft with Sky interior - flew out to Dublin on EI-FRR). Fantastic cabin crew who were enthusiastic about taking care of passengers and flight crew who gave us excellent updates on a 35 minute flight. Left Dublin 35 mins late due to slow turnaround at Manchester - however arrived 1 minute early. Will continue to only use Ryanair in the future (not flown with anyone else for nearly 5 years, I have no reason to change allegiances at all) and even get my flight-sceptic fiancée on board too!

However, I found a very cheap one way flight from Faro to London Stansted and couldn't resist. I paid for one large bag while checking in. We planned to take a second bag as a carry on. Check in was very easy although there are still quite a few extra things they give you the option of purchasing at the last minute which can be annoying. Got to the bag drop at Faro and was very surprised to be asked if we wanted to check the second bag in free of charge. Apparently they do this if the flight is not full. We sat near the back of the plane and had the three seats to ourselves. I really like the seat allocation as this has completely eliminated the mad rush that I remember. We didn't have anything to eat or drink as it was a short flight but we did buy our coach tickets from the FA and saved a few pounds. All staff encountered throughout were very friendly and helpful. The whole experience was a massive improvement on previous trips. I was very reluctant to fly with Ryanair but after this trip I have completely changed my mind . I would definitely use them again but it would depend on the price. It is very basic but perfectly acceptable for a short flight.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

This is the first time I have flown with Ryanair and I paid for business plus which was a total waste of money. I was expecting what they advertised, priority boarding, no hassle on checking-in lugagge and security. In fact, I was had to queue up like usual to check in luggage, I did jump to their so called ""BusinessPlus"" counter to ask where to check in, staff asked me to stay back and wait, and nothing happened. When I was about to go into the priority boarding area, staff stopped me and asked me loudly: ""you have priority?"" When the bus came and we are about to board priority staff again stopped me and asked me again, ""are you in priority?"" I did have priority boarding but not on the plane, but only on the bus that transported us to board the plane. So when boarding the plane, we still boarded as usual in a long queue. The seat onboard is normal and I was sitting in the front row near an aisle, which was really annoying as the corridor was so small and people kept going to the toilet located just in front of my seat, and therefore, I could not enjoy the ""long leg room"" as the space is just too small. Overall, Ryanair is economical to fly with but remember, don't waste money on upgrading especially Business Plus which is a totally waste of money. From my experience, you don't get priority on luggage checking in, security, boarding and thus, it is just a money rip off.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Very hard uncomfortable seat cushions but worth the extra for the legroom - more than 2 hours in one of the normal seats would be horrible to anyone over 5'7"" or so. Baggage off promptly. Return flight 20th May uneventful. Took off on time and landed at EMA on time only for Ryanair to spoil it by not ensuring busses were ready to transport us the 25 yards of so to the Terminal. Their stated 25 minute turnaround time was ruined for the next flight. Ryanair did what it said on the tin - if you follow the rules and watch weight allowances, hand baggage size etc you'll be fine. We will be trying Ryanair again with some American friends in September - let's see what they think. Finally, could really do without the hard sell of lottery tickets, and a Duty Free (In Europe?) run. And as for the stupid fanfare.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Unhappy with the customer service and attitude of the staff. When my flight was cancelled I was surprised with the lack of empathy and assistance that Ryanair staff offered. They did organise an alternative flight, however ignored my friend and I on numerous occasions, sent us running around the airport looking for our luggage without direction, shouted at other flyers whilst they were attempting to organise their return, did not offer food and drinks vouchers and were just unhelpful. Our luggage was left abandoned in Arrivals with no supervision whilst other desks were manned. It was a very scary experience for me never having a flight cancelled before. On my rescheduled flight boarding was delayed by 40 minutes as the check in staff did not offer hand luggage to be stored in the hold and the flight staff again looked very unhappy in their job resulting in a very depressing flight home.

Ryanair have much improved since I last flew with them around 5 years ago. Cabin crew both ways were friendly and their new uniforms look the part. The two bag policy is good and it sets them apart from other carriers and I'm glad they no longer micro examine the size of every carry on bag in the hope of eliciting some more money for a minor infringement - but truth be told, they've a lot of ground to make up on other low cost carriers who started to improve their customer experience long before Ryanair did. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped. No seat pocket annoys me and puts me off buying anything (still way overpriced). As does the broken tray table with a 45 degree slant meaning anything placed on it rolls into your lap. The fan fare on arrival irritates and is frankly crass. The seat rest and overhead bin adverts make remind me of a bus. The toilet is cramped. The occupier of the aisle seat next to me had a bag that didn't fit under the seat in front of him resulting my having to clamber over it to get out mid flight. That'd be fun in an emergency. I know they are upgrading their fleet with new seats and interiors and I realise they make a lot of short journeys so wear and tear is inevitable, but Easyjet manage to provide more comfortable and clean aircraft with a better environment so why can't Ryanair? Particularly as their prices are no longer quite as competitive as they were. I'll use them again where I have to but given a choice of paying 1/3 more and travelling with someone else, I will.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Tickets a bargain at £20 for both flights. First flight was on one of the newer 737s with the Boeing Sky Interior. Good legroom and the seat was comfortable enough for 40 minutes. Flight left a little late but made it up on the journey. Dublin Terminal 1 is a bit labyrinthine but that's hardly the fault of the airline. Crew friendly, didn't really interact with them to be honest. Flight home on a plane with the old interior. Once again a bit late leaving but landed on time. Seat fine again, but was getting the early pangs of backache so keep that in mind if you are booking a longer flight. Did notice that the crew were very frequent in announcements flogging duty free despite barely having the time to do a drinks run, but that's with the territory when you fly low cost, if that's an issue bring some headphones. Overall would fly again, especially for the money I paid.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

There was a fifteen minute delay that was understandable when we got to the gate we boarded with priority but once we boarded the aircraft it looked like a rubbish tip.

Baggage rules are now relaxed and gate staff were very willing to check in bags for people who wished to. I've been quite reluctant to fly with them in the past but this reticence has now been put to bed and would be more than happy to fly with them again.

This airline's business model is essentially, ""as long as it's cheap, they will buy it, no matter how badly we treat them"". If you find a really cheap flight with Ryanair, go for it, but just beware that if you try to change anything their customer services will not be helpful in any way or polite. The gates they get are always on the edges of the airport and they do not give you water on the plane if you ask for it. You have to buy bottled water. Every other airline I have flown gives you a cup of water. You will be charged for anything extra and it isn't cheap for the extra stuff (which includes suitcases). If you need to take suitcases, just take easyjet or another not budget airline. It might end up only being slightly more expensive and you will actually get treated well.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I fly this route several times a month and usually default to Aer Lingus as they can be cheaper if planned and booked in advance. This time fares on both airlines were exorbitant thanks to St Patrick's Day and the Cheltenham Festival and Ryanair came out cheaper. Brand new 737 with new interior and the very pleasant staff resplendent in their new uniforms. After a very stressful journey to the airport it was lovely to be greeted by such friendly staff, relaxing interior, comfortable seat (I had paid for exit seat for extra leg room so can't comment on the regular seats) and lovely relaxing music. It all felt surreal because our go-to response to anything Ryanair has usually always been negative but this looks like it's set to change. A few years ago, when I had taken my first Ryanair flight in many years I actually laughed at the state of the garish interior but not any more. Why ever did Ryanair not make these changes years ago, I imagine they are going to elicit quite the competitive response from competitors and not just from the no-frills market either. One comment I would always have to make about Ryanair is that although they can be categorised as 'no frills', the same can't be said about being a 'low fares' airline as some of the fares, particularly on this busy route can sometimes resemble long-haul fares. Apart from that, well done Ryanair and please keep up the relaxing music on boarding and disembarkation which is a really nice touch.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The price was cheap (40€ return), the seat pitch was ok and the flights were short and on time (return flight was 15 minutes late, not too bad). Minus points: most passengers have to check-in their carry on luggage at the gate so you have to wait at the luggage belt after arrival. Drinks and snacks on board are quite expensive in comparison with competitors (4,50€ for 0.33l Beer and 3.50€ for 0.5l Water) and there are no seat pockets so you have to hold books, magazines or tablet on your lap for the flight. I would recommend Ryanair if they have the best price by far and flight times fitting your plans, but I wouldn't choose them if the competitors are just a little more expensive.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Watch out for ""I'll bring your change later"" scam. This is the second time recently that a Ryanair steward has claimed not to have any change when selling me food and/or drink. He promised to bring it once he got some change, and I reminded him a few times, but still he didn't. The first time this happened to me, I was obliged to let it go. The second time, yesterday, I went and found my steward just before we started landing and asked him to go now and get me my change. He blushed, and did so. It wasn't much, one euro, but each euro pocketed is a euro stolen - from Ryanair, from me the passenger - oh and a percentage from the taxman too. But right in front of your seat there is a notice, saying that every sale will be accompanied by a receipt. I didn't get one - or think to ask for it. That's how they get away with it. Always demand your receipt on RyanAir, even if it's only for a couple of quid.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We had no problems stowing our luggage in the overhead lockers (which we had carefully measured to ensure it was the correct size after reading too many horror stories of people with oversize cabin baggage). The flight attendants were friendly. We hadn't realised we needed to have our boarding passes stamped by a visa check person at the Ryanair desk before security (it was on the ticket but we just hadn't read it). We were lucky that the staff at the gate kindly offered to do the visa check for us instead.

Not only did she not greet anyone, she was rolling her eyes throughout the safety demonstration she was performing - the only thing she was demonstrating was how bored she was! However, the cherry on top was that she broke a bag! She broke the handle off a bag when closing the over head bin, picked it up from the floor and shoved it back in beside the bag as if nothing had happened! I was outraged and I wasn't the only one. So what is the procedure when a member of staff breaks a passengers suitcase? Hide the evidence and hope nobody notices? The only brief moment this woman cracked a smile was when everyone was getting off the plane and she was glad to see the back of them.

Therefore we decided to check in at the airport. The clerk at Ryanair was not helpful and told us we had to check in at another counter managed by SwissAir. We were there almost 2 hours ahead so when we went to check in we were told that there is an extra fee for checking in within two hours of flight. €45 per person. We were shocked that there was this sort of fee enough so that we will never use Ryanair again. The service was mediocre on the flight, the seats had little leg room (good thing we are not large people). Luckily the flight was short.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

With the new approach, much more passenger friendly attitude when it comes to the cabin luggage and assigned seats they really made a huge change. A bit worried before the last flight from Treviso to Tenerife South due to 4+ hour duration of the flight, however also this flight better than with traditional carriers. On time, both cabin crews extremely nice, even the seating not bad, mostly due to non-reclining seats. Good job.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

So from Edinburgh to Barcelona I printed my boarding pass and asked them what should we do on our way back since the app did not work and we may not have access to a printer on our way back, They said since the app did not work for us it would be ok and they will print a boarding pass for us free of charge at Barcelona. Of course they didn't and charged us 30 euros for a piece of paper. They don't have a decent customer service even for payment and we had to stay in a long queue for nearly an hour. They claim to be cheap but I don't consider £300 per person for 1:30 hrs flight ""cheap"". Anyways I will avoid them if I can.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Flight crew very good and attentive. Seats OK for the roughly three hour flight front row are narrow though because of the trays in the arm rest but that offset by the monumental leg room available in 1A.

About 2 hours later we were still on the aircraft - told they will contact Ryanair and get back to us in 20 minutes - this became an hour later. Told we would be disembarking and hopefully depart later when the wind had died down. A further hour later we were still waiting for ground crew to take us into the terminal building - not enough staff on duty. Finally told ok to take off so we departed after 4 hours sitting on the aircraft. After 2 or 3 hours (depending upon miles of flight) one is entitled to refreshments, phone calls and emails. This is obviously not able to happen on board the aircraft, so Ryanair leave you there so they do not have to pay out for anything. After this delay everyone was obviously hungry, so Ryanair made a fortune on inflight food and beverage sales.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Cabin crew were just downright miserable and didn't look to be enjoying their jobs. All were foreign and very difficult to understand, same for the flight crew. I wouldn't like to think what they would have been like if we were depending on them in the case of an on-board emergency. Seats were a bit uncomfortable for a 4.5 hour flight but, that's acceptable for the low price we paid. Priority boarding is well worth the extra if you are taking a hand-luggage size suitcase on board to make sure that there is space available in the overhead lockers.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We received a very short text from Ryanair on the Monday evening to inform us that our flight had been cancelled due to an air traffic control strike in France and a link to rebook our flight. We didn't know what to do at that point. We tried to call their customer service team but could not get an answer - later discovered they all go home at 6pm, because all problems go away at 6pm clearly. We eventually got hold of someone the following morning who told us that they would put us on the next flight to Edinburgh - 6 days later. Having small children at home and a job to go to this was not acceptable. Neither was their insistence that they would not pay for our extra accommodation costs as 'it wasn't their fault'. We discovered that Ryanair were the only airline that cancelled flights due the strike - everyone else just diverted. When we questioned them on this they could not give us any answer. After much discussion, they finally agreed to transfer our booking to a flight from Alicante to Dublin on Thursday (2 days) later however we would then not be able to get a connecting flight to Edinburgh until the Friday morning. On asking if they would put us up for the night in Dublin we were told no, we could keep our receipts and claim back but nothing was gauranteed - as again 'it wasn't their fault'. To add insult to injury, the flight from Dublin to Edinburgh was delayed. We had to pay out for 2 nights accommodation in Spain, a night in Dublin, meals, extra car parking at Edinburgh. Never will I fly with Ryanair again, their attitude towards their customers is disgraceful. My only positive comment - the cabin crew on the flight to Alicante to Dublin were very friendly and cheerful.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Flight from Manchester was full, boarding was fast and everything was smooth and efficient, flight arrived on time at Rome Ciampino. The return flight was a bit chaotic, the gate was like a bunch of farm animals and boarding was extremely chaotic and hectic. The flight departed over 30 minutes late and landed 15 minutes behind schedule at Manchester. Seats are really tight, I'm 6ft and my knees are pretty much touching the back of the seat in front of me. Cabin crew on both flights were very friendly and helpful.

Any deviation will cost you almost as much as the ticket. The flight from Amsterdam to Dublin was full so some people had a little difficulty with their cabin baggage. If you have cabin baggage make it as light as possible or pay the extra to put it in the hold. If you insist make sure you get to the gate early. Ryanair have taken some slots in terminal H at Amsterdam. It is a new section of the airport and everything worked very well.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Flew from Luton to Valletta. They tell you that you can take a bag into the cabin and then spend the next hour or so harassing you at every opportunity and asking you if you would like to check in that bag for free. The seats are bolt upright and cannot be moved, the pockets on the seat in front of you have vanished and there is approximately 4 inches between your knees and the seat in front (for a person with average length legs anyway). If you sit next to the window you end up freezing cold and getting wet as ice forms on the inside of the cabin wall and when you point it out on the way off the plane the pilot explains that it's because their air conditioning system is so efficient that it ices up. The call to go to the boarding desk is far too early which results in at over 150 people standing strung out across the boarding gates for three quarters of an hour whilst the staff checking you through to the plane know full well that the plane hasn't even landed, and of course they are happily chatting away in their seats behind the desk so they don't care. This is just cruel and unfair, especially to those people who find standing around quite difficult. The staff on board the aircraft were more interested in gossiping and playing around than paying attention to the passengers. They know that most people won't buy anything because Ryanair rip you off so they are totally disinterested in what they are doing. One of the staff doing the announcements did so in such heavily accented English that it was almost impossible to understand what she was saying. I thought Easyjet was bad but even they are better than Ryanair and that takes some doing. I will never fly with this company again.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Cabin crew friendly and efficient. We paid for extra leg room seats in row 1, but for most of the journey people queueing for the lavatory occupied some of the space to stretch out into.

My partner and I arrived at the airport for our flight from Rome to Barcelona only to discover that with Ryanair you are required to check-in online or be charged at 45 euro fee per passenger! This wouldn’t have been an issue if it were clearly stated in the confirmation email they sent when we booked, however it was only make clear in an email sent to us shortly before the flight. As we were travelling we had limited email access (which I feel is far from unusual when people are travelling). This is a pretty cynical way of extorting extra fees from their customers, as they know that a certain percentage of people will not receive the eleventh hour email and be forced to pay the fee or be stranded. We were arrived an hour and a half before our flight and they still wanted 45 euros to print two pieces of paper!

When I contacted the customer services, they informed me that they have a standard price of 110euros/pound to change the name, so almost the double of the price of the ticket price. This was definitely my first and last time I go though Ryanair to fly. No point saying that the ticket that I bought will not be used and it was money literally to the bin.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I used the new help chatline on the webpage, explained my dilemma, the staff checked my booking and in less than a minute had seperated my booking into two - allowing me to fly to Manchester using the details of my old passport, and as soon as I obtained my new passport checking in for my return.

I booked in July for a holiday to Faro in December, party of 4, of which 3 are disabled, 2 of which needed to use the abulift to access the aircraft. I booked special assistance at the time of booking and was allocated specific seats for out party to be able to access easily. We all booked in and went to special assistance area. All fine and good! Well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. Flight called, we were taken to board the plane. Wait theres a massive problem, theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift, but we were told Ryanair would only take 4! It seemed 2 others hadn't pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and Ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldn't take more than 4! We got as far as the tarmac, sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. We were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance, thankfully I always keep the paperwork safe. No other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. It seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help. Ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was, for us to actually get on the plane. We were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its Ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. Maybe when Ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous, it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag, forget those who are confined to a chair. As a result I'd never fly with them again. I was made to feel like a nuisance.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

When we landed we were told that we'd be refuelling and taking off in 30-40 mins. After 1 hr 55 mins we were told to get off the plane to get food and drink. We were then dumped at the baggage carousel. Didn't even go through passport control and the next thing our bag were coming off. No one knew what was going on. We had to leave the airport and go to the Ryanair counter.

I wish they would give you options for more legroom though. But given this 60 minute flight from Madrid to Tangier, I was able to keep my composure.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The low-cost price of my return Ryanair ticket was € 310. Not exactly what I would call cheap for a 1 hour 10 minute flight. Safety and security instructions were given on a low volume PA system so that few people could barely hear it. Onboard, the seat was filthy from last passengers' food waste, the carpet was filthy with chewing gum, food and chips, and even the shabby looking steward didn't bother to put his shirt inside his trousers. Also, it looked as if his shirt apparently hadn't been ironed for a few weeks. Ordered a drink and a sandwich, was prompted to pay €17. After having done the maths for the stewardess, the price was suddenly €10. Ryanair has some kind of lottery sale onboard their flights. I don't know what this is all about, but it seemed a lot more interesting for cabin staff than the safety instructions. Upon landing in Kaunas I asked a steward what the local time was, but he had no idea that the time zone was one hour ahead of the departure airport. This is a filthy airline, and staff couldn't care less. Some claim that low-cost is the future of flying. However, I have absolutely no trust in this joke of an airline.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Now I do not know any other company that does this! 40 Euros is £29! So why I am being asked to pay £11 extra than the chap from Euro zone? On top of that there is 5eur/GPB charge for adding a bag after you have booked the ticket (not sure what this covers as this is simply to add to my eTicket that I have also booked a bag). So that's another 10£, so in total I have to pay £50 when a chap from euro zone pays £36(50 Euros) on the same flight! I'll be honest if I had a choice I would never fly with this airline, unfortunately I don't as they are the only airline that fly to my destination direct.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

This is good as one of their main European hubs (Orio al Serio) is 5km from my house and from there I can fly everywhere in Europe. I flew to Zaragoza for a short business trip two days ago and everything went very smoothly: on-time departures, clean aircraft, friendly and polite crew. The price was EUR 120 return but I booked just 9 days before so it is still a good price considering this destination is very difficult to be reached via Madrid or Barcelona and a direct flight from my hometown is a huge plus. I think their website did improve a lot too, less tricky than before and much easier to use. If they keep improving this way, they will likely see me more often onboard.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Unfortunately I was told that they could not make this change and I had to pay another 110ers again to make that change. It was a genuine mistake which was going to cost me another 110ers.

Pushed off and landed on-time, if not a few minutes early. Fairly full plane but had a spare seat to stretch into, so more comfortable than the usual Ryanair seating. Cabin crew cheerful and pleasant. There can't be many people on this earth who don't know that budget airlines make their profit from quite pricey on-board food. I reckoned a good 80% of the passengers bought food and/or drinks on the plane, and seemed to be doing so from choice. So why complain that it is dear? Take food with you if you're that bothered.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

People kept trying to go to the toilet and were told to sit back down because the seatbelt light was on. There was no turbulance and no reason for the seatbelt sign to be on. I think they forgot to turn it off and made people sit in discomfort. Very annoyed because I was obviously one of those people. Our luggage also took 1.5hrs to come out which was annoying because I had to meet my B&B host at a certain time.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Disappointing customer service today. Ryanair tries so hard to reestablish its image in the eyes of Internet. However, the attitude towards their customers is still miserable. I couldn't check-in on their website, neither could my friend the day before. We both had the same bug. I've contacted Ryanair through live chat and they said they don't have any bugs, and probably it's my problem. They advised me to use Mozilla instead of Safari and Chrome. The representative asked me if it was fixed and without waiting for my reply immediately added ""Goodbye"" and logged out. Situation 2 (with happy ending this time). Within 24 hours of my booking I decided to change the date of my flight. On live chat they've reassured me that it was changed. One day before my flight when I decided to check-in I found out that the date wasn't changed, and it caused a lot of stress. I was really lucky they still had some seats for a preferred date. Though this time they apologised and immediately changed the date, I appreciated that. On other note, the advantage is its low cost. However, most of times I prefer same-priced but more polite Wizzair.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

This flight from Warsaw to Madrid on had something unpleasantly memorable for me. I was sitting in the back (28 or 29) in an aisle seat. The flight attendant who was in charge of the back was a man, a strong and big one. The space between Ryanair seats are tight and also the aisle is not a wide one. Thus it was very difficult for that flight attendant to move. I never forget how he (unintentionally) hit my head with his elbow when he was trying to move in the aisle serving drinks to passengers. To my surprise, he didn't even turn back to say sorry. He might not have realized that he ever hit me! To cut a long story short, Ryanair can change the space between seats in order to host more passengers as long as the passengers are informed beforehand (like their rules about printed boarding pass), but their employees ought to fit in their technical amendments and measurements!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The negatives (which mainly focus on Stansted). Absolutely useless ground staff, once the departure gate was eventually flashed up on screen we joined the heaving mass crushed onto the little shuttle to the gate for a mad dash (due to the short notice). Once we arrived at the lounge, we were met with total chaos due to zero management (none visible). Queues were criss crossing each other and people were getting most upset. I asked one of only two staff checking two different flights (no other staff were available) which queue was which, to which she replied, ""I don't know it's all over the place back there"". Once we got to our desk, the lady checking us did not make eye contact, she simply looked at the pass glanced at our passports and said go through, an opportunity for a security check missed. After walking across the cold wet runway we got to the plane to find out that the back door had only just been opened, so of course earlier boarders had had to use the front door, which of course meant utter chaos on board. Anyway a second security check was missed here as the girl checking our seat passes only looked at one. Come on Ryanair, you seriously need to sort out this appalling issue. Who is to blame? The airport or the carrier? I will not be using Ryanair again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

(Even with the surcharge imposed for credit card use I paid less than via Ryanair's guaranteed rate). Apart from that possible catch in the booking process, everything else about our Ryanair experience was fine. Boarding was efficiently handled and even a difficulty with our boarding passes - the barcodes could not be read - caused no comment. The cabin crew did sterling work managing to stow everyone's cabin bags in overhead lockers, even telling passengers whose bags had to be located away from their seats where exactly their bags were to be found. There certainly seems to be a more customer-friendly approach from Ryanair these days and we are less apprehensive about being caught out in some minor, but expensive, infringement. Though it's still wise to read all the small print before flying, we are now quite ready to choose Ryanair if flight times and prices suit us. We still find their 'leather' seats less than comfortable after a couple of hours, however.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Cabin crew do not bother you, but quick to react if you want something to eat. I ordered a 5 euro lasagne which was adequate for the flight. I avoid their drinks as they are overpriced so bring my own water. What ruins the Ryanair experience the most is flying into Stansted Airport. What a joke of an airport, it is enough to make me avoid flying Ryanair unless they are at least 30 Euros per leg cheaper.

Not because we're out of money, just because the flight schedules were better, we wanted to arrive early in Rome. So we went in the Boeing 737 and there wasn't much of leg space. The cabin crew was friendly. In the middle of the flight there was a kind of shop aboard and other commercial stuff. The ground service at Brussels Airport wasn't that good, it was very chaotic. But, if you compare that with the low fares, you can't complain much. I had a pleasant flight without any problems.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

As an orderly queue of travellers were gathering we joined the ever increasing line, this staff member came along and blurted out to us towards the rear of the queue ""your hand luggage must go in the hold"" and started just in front of us to put yellow tags on. He was asked had he done the same to the front of the line and he replied no - just from here back, 38 bags, in the rudest way you could imagine. He explained ""I have the right to do what I want"". Come on Ryanair step up to it and stop your staff talking rubbish and being rude to the passengers.

Departing from Stansted very early on Wednesday morning the weather was horrible and raining very hard. The aircraft was off jetty so had to be boarded by steps front and rear. 2 passengers were in wheel chairs and clearly unable to walk at any great speed let alone climb stairs. Boarding commenced with passengers having to walk quickly to the aircraft steps only to find at the rear that one of the elderly was making very slow progress up the stairs. A queue quickly formed as she progressed excruciatingly slowly with help from family members up the stairs. In the meantime, without any cover, passengers waiting to board became totally drenched. I got to my seat as with many others looking literally as if I had just stepped out of a shower fully clothed. Is it really beyond their wit to either have as high loader to facilitate wheelchair passengers onto an aircraft that is off jetty, or if this cannot be managed, hold back general boarding for just 5 minutes while all passengers needing assistance are able to board, thereby avoiding the angst and drenching!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Its ticket (once you added a checked bag and reserved seat) was actually more expensive than Aegean, however, it had a slightly better schedule. Check-in costs €45 but online check-in with mobile app was free. OK, did this. Then informed I couldn't use electronic boarding card, so would have to pay €15 at airport. After silliness with customer service, who sent me (very) fine print detail that does indeed say non-EU cannot use mobile app, then stopped talking with me. I finally went and found a hotel to print hard copy for me. Then, there was the mayhem boarding (agents ignored ""priority boarding"" (glad I didn't pay for that!). Once on board, we found space for our small bags and settled into the most uncomfortable seats, only to have flight ""attendants"" (cattle movers) start taking bags down so that those with larger bags could put them up. If you had a soft bag (even if large) they pulled it down to go on floor so that those with huge hard shell bags could put them up. Never seen that before.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

When we finally got to boarding the aircraft a member of staff told us we were the 90th passengers, therefore our bags would be put in the hold for free with no lock on. Fair enough. However, after boarding the aircraft we found that many people behind us were entering with bigger cabin bags which hadnt been put in the hold and that there was indeed space in the bin above our seat. This started to annoy me particularly as passengers who got on with their bags (I don't know why) with the assistance of their cabin crew came from all over the aircraft to put their bags and coats in our overhead locker whereas we had to sacrifice our personal items to be put in the hold. Luckily for Ryanair, the flight was uneventful and our bags arrived safely. Overall, if after ninety pieces of cabin baggage have boarded the plane, enforce the 'putting cabin bags in the hold' rule fairly and accurately.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I made the supreme mistake of not checking in on ine prior to arriving at the airport. I was told that before I could receive the boarding passes it would cost another 45 euros each my wife and myself. It's mandatory. This, after I had paid for the tickets online with my visa card. Not having a choice, I coughed up the 90 euros so we could catch a connecting flight with an ethical airline company. I am a 71 yr old retired business man with many transactions under my belt but have never in my 50 years of business been the victim of extortion. Ryanair is no longer a ""lower fares"", honest, ethical or even decent airline with which to do business. If I should ever find myself in the position of having to fly to a place served only by Ryanair, I will either walk or not go there.

Chose Ryanair over airlines departing from Schiphol, because Eindhoven Airport is more convenient (small airport, with very fast check in/customs, boarding and luggage delivery - from landing to car in 20 mins). With Ryanair you know what to expect. Cramped seats and except for carry-on luggage, everything else will cost you. Value for money is good though, especially if you book in time and don't need to bring much luggage. Both flights were uneventful and arrived on time. The flight from Dublin to Eindhoven (Friday) was however boarded by a rather large group of semi-drunk Irish (wo)men who continued their drinking during the flight, had to use the toilets all the time and blocked the aisle. Headphones provided a welcome layer of isolation. For some reason, on the return flight there was more cabin luggage than could be fitted in the lockers. This was solved by putting whatever wouldn't fit on the floor of some free seats. Not sure if this is standard procedure, seemed a bit odd. Anyway, it was the standard Ryanair experience. If you don't mind the lack of comfort and service, it is perfectly fine for a couple of hours and good value for money.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

At check-in if you do not pay extra for a seat selection you will be assigned the worst seat available. Some rows will remain completely empty but you will be asked to stay in your assigned seat and fly squeezed between two passengers. A second problem is that in order to be more customer friendly Ryanair now allows or does not care anymore if you take two or more pieces of luggage into the cabin. Some are huge and well over the size allowance. The result is either you board early or you will not find space for your small piece of luggage anymore. Boarding early does not help if you carry a soft bag as you will later see that the crew even help to squeeze hard suitcases into the overhead holds not caring about the content of your soft suitcase. On this fight I was shocked to see that about 15 very big suitcases were stored in empty rows placed in the free space between rows, the aircraft was about to take off when the chief assistant asked the assistants to remove the bags and place them elsewhere. Bags and suitcases were not put under the seats either, most of them were just put between seats.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

There were mid-flight advretisements which I thought was strange (I'm used to flying nicer airlines). However, nothing during the flight bothered me.

In contrast, Ryanair staff were surly and officious. After a pretence at asking for volunteers to have cabin baggage put into the hold 'free of charge' the staff member decided to pick on the middle of a long line. We explained that the child travelling with us was unwell, having been taking Calpol through the day, and asked if she would not transfer our luggage to the hold, especially as our arrival would be late evening. Asked about how long the delay at baggage reclaim would take, the staff member became very officious and suggested we were arguing with her. We had not been asked to give her our boarding passes until she had become very defensive - ""Are you going to give me your boarding passes?"" - when we handed them over immediately. She was obviously having a bad day, and did not transfer anyone else's baggage to the hold after us. We were left to remove valuables and repack our bags. As someone who works in a customer-focused business, I find it hard to believe that staff can get away with rudeness and off-handed comments on a daily basis. I also note that the baggage label suggested that our baggage would not be covered by Article 4 of the Warsaw Convention. This was not pointed out to us. I will avoid Ryanair at all costs in the future.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

All seemed well. We had concerns after being delayed on the outbound flight from Edinburgh, 2 weeks earlier. After standing on a staircase for 10-15 minutes we were told to return to the departure lounge. The staff, not Ryanair, told us there was a problem with the plane and it may take at least an hour to resolve. We received no more updates and the notice boards simply said boarding and gate closed. At approx 9:15, the notice boards stated we had to board again, but from a different gate. The plane was fully boarded by 9:45am. The doors were closed at 10:02am, and we took off at 10:15am. This was a delay of 2 hours and 15 minutes. The captain said it was down to Spanish air traffic control, they told us it was French air traffic control that caused the outbound delay. As Ryanair's terms state that if you are delayed by at least 2 hours, you will receive a text stating your rights, explaining compensation etc. No text received. When I challenged the stewards they said they thought it was 3 hours, not 2! Wow they didn't even know their own rules. They weren't willing to help at all and said I should just complain directly to Ryanair. Which I will be doing. The staff were more interested in selling as many snacks and drinks as possible, rather than apologising for the delay and issuing passengers with a food and drinks voucher.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I had a nice cup of coffee on the flight and while it cost 50% more than I might have liked, it was good quality. The flight was not completely full so there were few issues with hand luggage and so on, and I like being able to take two bags with me as this saves a great deal of hassle. Downsides were due to Stansted's overcrowding. There is nowhere to sit while you wait for a flight, as they are rebuilding. The security is chaotic and unnecessarily stressful as they have not invested very intelligently in the screening equipment and they have rather bizarrely chosen hardware that increases rather than reduces processing time. Finally we were somewhat kettled in a holding bay near gate 88 by ground crew without explanation before boarding, while another flight disgorged its passengers, and I think it might have been better for Ryanair to send us down a bit later, as some of the families and older passengers grew uncomfortable with nowhere to sit. The Stansted experience is starting to put me off using EasyJet and Ryanair, and I often choose Heathrow and scheduled flights instead. In Ryanair's case, the cost difference between many of their tickets and a scheduled flight is now negligible and sometimes the scheduled flights are even cheaper and include more, so I wonder if Ryanair will be in business in a few years' time, despite their efforts to be less nasty to passengers.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

On arrival to the airport I was informed that I had not checked in online and there would be a 47 Euro charge to do so at that time. They claim they sent me an email alerting me to this request. I then discovered the request at the very bottom of a lengthy email which I needed my reading glasses to see. The email heading was that of a receipt for my flight, following which there were large, bright colored advertisements and after that offers to increase legroom, check in extra baggage etc. All of these were prominently displayed. The heading of the email had nothing to do with checking in online. I was refused boarding unless I paid the extra cash by the haughty person behind the desk - I simply left and took a cab back to Porto.

Was rather upset with Ryanair. Overall, flight was mediocre and cabin rather dirty (food from prior flight still on floors).

Reason being I had booked a flight (bus flex) for my daughter and her friend (14 and 15 yrs). During the booking no ""warning"" was given and also while trying to checkin, which did not work, no mention of the fact that children under 16 are not allowed to fly without anyone above 16 in company. By chance parents of the friend found out under AGBs that our children are not allowed to fly on their own. With repetitive chat, call and email I am told - it is written in the AGBs! Ridiculous - if you would have children stuck in a foreign country without money and place to live you give a damn to AGBs which are almost always ignored anyway. I had to break my schedule, spend hundreds of Euros to just pick up the two experienced travellers vs many above 16 I know who cannot travel alone. If Ryanair wants to stick to this ridiculous rule, they ought to find a way to cleary and ""loudly"" inform during the booking. If I had not been able to pick them up, the expensive bus flex tickets would also go waste. All just because I did not see a need to read the AGBs!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Confronted with large queue at Lanzarote airport, however this moved pretty fast. Boarding started on time and having priority boarding meant we got to spend longer on a flight of stairs before boarding started. Seat 17b had lots of leg room and was comfortable. The best part of the flight was the Spanish cabin crew who were very good/friendly.

On arrival, we were advised that we had to checkin at least 2 hours before departure, despite clearly stating that Business Plus fares were excluded from this rule, hence the premium, they than charged 45.00 per person, in total 135 GPB or 297.00 AUD. They wouldn't print the boarding passes until the charged was made to my credit card. We then had to have the seats allocated, at which stage they allocated the same seat to my wife and myself, when we queried, she is no, at which time we advised her to look at the boarding passes, and then she reallocated the seating. On arrival at the gate, we waited in queue under a glass roof which was more like a hothouse, they then open another queue allowing other passengers to board the aircraft, leaving those that had paid the additional fee to wait. It wasn't until the priority boarding queue starting to voice their thoughts that they stopped the other queue boarding. Once onboard, the aircraft seems to be out of the dark ages, excessively old compared to Australian budget airlines. Seats are very narrow and uncomfortable. On seeking a refund for the 135.00, they confirmed the fee was charged incorrectly and would refund. However they wouldn't refund to my credit card, that I would have to wait 3-4 weeks and receive the payment by cheque. I advised that this was not satisfactory and that they should refund the credit to the credit card, at which time they discontinued the conversation and forwarded me to a customer survey. Don't fly Ryanair. There are better budget airlines that deserve your business.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

After dropping off our suit case we made our way through to security, the queue was horendous where we patiently waited. The minutes ticked past where my partner said we need to board by 08:15, it was 07:50 by this time where we continued to patiently wait. In the end we had to catch a member of staffs attention as it was now 08:10 and the last call for the gate closing was made, we were put to the front of the queue. I have diabetes where I had to hand over my insulin to security as it cannot go through xray, he handed it to a colleague who walked off with it. As I went through my insulin had gone, I asked where's my insulin to which no one knew. I did make some noise about this where I felt I was going to be taken to one side, eventually he pointed me in the right direction to his colleague who had my insulin. After collecting my insulin we had to run from security to gate 30 along with many others, it was horendous. We were a few of the last ones allowed through the gate that morning where the flight was clearly late. Ryanair should have prioritised the passengers who were queuing to get through in time, from arrival to the airport we stood for over 2 hours waiting in queues. Ryanair had a nuber of gates closed on the morning we departed which needs to be addressed, if we had missed our flight we would have had to pay for another one.

It's nothing to shout home about. However, because we forgot to check in online, we were stung with a £100 charge at Luton airport, and this took a big chunk of our holiday money. The flight was smooth, and we were glad we booked priority seats, because flying with Ryanair before, we were well aware of how uncomfortable the seats can be. However, they are not exactly the most comfortable of seats at the front row too. The staff were very nice. The price of the food was too expensive. It cost us £5.50 for a ham and cheese panini, which was priced as €5 in the brochure. Our flight was £200, and all of those charges on top of that was not worth the time or day for a one hour flight. After going through that, this is the last time we are flying with Ryanair.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

All seemed to be fine until I tried to print out my boarding passes that same morning as our flight. I tried several times but their site would not complete the process and I had no choice but to leave for the airport. Ryanair charges for printing up boarding passes at the airport (20 pounds a person) so I went to the customer service desk and explained my situation to them. Without blinking an eyelash, their service person said there was nothing she could do and I had to pay the charge regardless. She even called my honesty into question. While we were waiting in line, we had conversations with 2 other passengers that encountered the same problem. Reviewing others comments online, I can now see that this is an ongoing complaint with Ryanair. I will challenge this charge with my credit card company, but for now I just want to alert others to this scam. This is a budget airline and they live up to the title, the seats did not even recline (at least on our flight) and their customer service should be call customer disservice, just horrible.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We arrived on time checked in and flight was on indicator board. Went through security and in to departure lounge indicator board showed delay, one hour later indicator board showed diverted. Ryanair reps were very evasive, passengers all upset given a food voucher for 5 euros could only have bottle of water and cheese sandwich and passengers told flight would not be leaving until 1pm Monday. Ryanair staff said had a technical difficulty passengers told to go to arrivals area. No further information. No reps to be seen and had to sleep, or should I say try to sleep, on airport seats. I am 76 years old and found it very uncomfortable and painful. Monday morning arrived plane on tarmac watched by the passengers was being repaired - okay, there was a thunderstorm on Sunday night but it was hot dry and sunny from 8am on Monday but the plane was still not ready to fly at 1pm. Finally flew back at 3.45pm. Asked for a cup of tea on the plane, told I could have a cup of tea but no milk or sugar on board. Will never use the airline again given forms for compensation not worth the paper they are written on no compensation due as delay was supposedly due to unusual circumstances quite sure they will have received many complaints about this flight. Another plane which was delayed (easyJet) all the passengers on that flight were taken by coach to a B&B and they flew out the following morning long before Ryanair finally flew out.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

After emailing to ask for an explanation for this extortionate price hike - given that oil and fuel costs are at one of their lowest - I was dissatisfied with their response that they always offer the best price on their website (where else would I be looking?). The following is their list of price determining factors : number of passengers already booked on a flight : flight time : Day of travel : time of year - high season/low season etc. Given that we are travelling on the same flights and the same period which have virtually only just become available I fail to see how such a price increase can be justified other than pure greed and the mindset that they have a captive audience. As the accommodation had already been booked we had no option but to book Ryanair on this occasion but I can assure them that it will be my last flight with them. Shame on you Ryanair and goodbye.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The busy Friday evening flight from Liverpool to Dublin I took last week was no different to usual. Online checkin is very easy especially if you download the free app - it will cost you if you forget to check in on time or for some bizarre reason you believe that you don't need one and turn up at airport with just your luggage, passport and a smile! The ground staff checked tickets and passports. If for some reason you decide to bring large baggage with you, you will be charged. The airline are far less strict about size and number of bags carried these days. Ryanair staff are patient in my experience, they take alot of abuse from a minority of passengers who can't be bothered following basic rules. The flight is short. Inflight service is as you'd expect of a 35 minute flight. A steal for £40 return.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Booked seats and priority boarding only to ensure cabin luggage was nearby and quick exit. Flight out was delayed due to spillage by passenger on arriving aircraft. Ryanair build extra time into their flight schedule so delay didn't effect arrival time in Malaga. All crew were pleasant, especially on the return leg to Dublin. Return flight was ahead of schedule. I love that the seats don't recline and impact on your space, however seat pitch is tight but bearable. My big worry with the both flights is the amount of luggage now allowed on board. Aside from the overhead lockers been packed with luggage the floor space was extremely congested to the point I felt trapped in my seat if there was any emergency.

We have always booked online and never had an issue with any other airline until it had come to our attention that we had to pay to sit together with was £20 each. At the time we assumed it was because we had booked short notice so we was fine to pay that. However, when we got to the airport (after checking in online a week before ) we were asked to pay £70 each for luggage on the way there and £35 each on the way back! I was so angry as there is nothing that states when you book your holiday that you have to ""check in"" your luggage too? The only question you are asked is if you want to check in ""extra luggage"" - well to me we didn't have extra it was just a standard suitcase and hand luggage (which pretty much everyone takes when they go away). So when you book online that's how they catch you out as they word it wrong by saying extra luggage rather than just a standard luggage. The staff were really abrupt and rude and not really bothered about the hassle this had caused us. Following this, my partner had to ask about luggage on the way back they didn't inform us. Again, there was nothing whilst we were booking to inform us that we had to do this only to check in ""extra luggage"" and I was not aware that my only suitcase had to be classed as extra. Its very misleading! We normally don't take our bank cards with us on holiday but its a good job we did. To everyone that reads this please take it on board as some people may not be able to afford that kind of money upfront when they charge you which was what happened to the couple in front of us! The staff at the desk said that the information was in the ""small print"" which I think is awful as a vital piece of information like that, in my opinion, should not be in the small print! I have never known so much hassle to go on holiday in all my life and we have booked before with other airlines online and never ever had any issues with luggage. We will never fly with Ryanair again and strongly advise to anyone who is thinking of flying with them to think carefully and go with another airline if you can as you will probably end up paying again what you pretty much paid for the holiday. We feel robbed by Ryanair, they are sneaky and misleading!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Online check in, so got to airport in plenty of time, but lines getting through security so long we almost missed flight! Gate almost half an hour away from security. Usual melee on board, staff pressuring people to buy rubbish food, drinks, duty free goods and lottery tickets (and complaining loudly to each other when failing to do so!) Big problem when we came in to land at Chania airport. Pilot failed on first attempt - think he was travelling far too fast for runway - and despite perfect weather conditions, we had to climb again and were then an extra 20 mins in sky and ten mins landing. No explanation given by crew, lots of people worried in case it was a pervasive mechanical problem (unable to drop landing gear for example) or just a careless pilot - neither are happy thoughts to have as you circle your destination! So no phoney, fixed ""on time landing"" song to endure, but no apology or explanation either.

I arrived 2 hrs early at around 1130 for the 1335 flight. At around 1300 our Boarding Cards were checked and we went down the ramp to embark. At around 1320 we were asked to return to the Departure Lounge due to a technical issue. For the next 3 hrs we were not advised of the issue nor of the plans to get us back to the UK. Gradually over that time people would ask the 2 (relatively junior) staff members of Ryanair and 'news', or lack of it, would filter down the line. No announcements were made. By around 1700 we heard that a plane was on its way and we would depart at around 1930. Ok, 6 hrs delay but at least we'd be home. The 2 officials then handed out photocopies of the EU regulations regarding flight delays etc - useful, but to be honest we just wanted to get home! As can be imagined, people then were asking lots of questions of the 2 lads. At around the same time food vouchers were being handed out and stamped by the 2 officials. However, not one of the food outlets would take the vouchers because Ryanair had tried this in the past and had not paid their bills to the food outlets! At around 1830 the 1930 departure disappeared off the departures list. We heard that another flight had been delayed and our rescue plane had been used for those passengers - presumably to avoid 2 sets of compensation!! Time progressed slowly, we then found out that a flight would take us back to the UK around 2305. The flight actually left at 2330 - 10 hrs late. During the 10 hrs, the 200 or so customers were shunted at least 5 times between Gates - can you imagine 200 people racing around getting from A to B! Ok, these things happen. Lessons to be learnt? Ryanair, have someone on the ground such as a manager to deal with the situation and inform people officially by adequate communication. Pay your bills to the local food outlets. Having reported all the above, I've travelled extensively for the past few years to Spain and back and used Ryanair a lot. Mostly they are cheap and get you there on time; its just at times such as the above where you realise their service is quite flaky. I hope this accurately reflects events the other day and it will help someone in some way.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

My flight to London was delayed for almost 3 hours; none of the staff at the gate informed us about what was going on and what the reason for the delay was (only when people started walking up to them and asked, everyone kind of found out from the people sitting next to them). Conveniently the flight was delayed just a little under 3 hours so you're not even able to claim a refund. Because of the delay I missed my connecting flight in London (it was already about 8pm), which is why I went to ask for assistance. Their employee was pretty rude and offered no help; she just told me that I booked the two flights at my own risk and that I wasn't gonna get any assistance by Ryanair. Unfortunately there was no flight left to my final destination that day (which I would have had to pay out of my own pocket, of course), which is why I had to book an overnight bus and had a horrible 24hr trip instead of 8 hrs. On my flights back everything luckily went smoothly, but I noticed that boarding was really chaotic at all flights (a woman with her baby in a stroller was pretty much first in line to board and had to wait about 20 mins until all other passengers had boarded to get some help carrying the stroller down the stairs - of course, staff also weren't able to turn on the escalator at least). I wouldn't fly with Ryanair again, because despite their (in my case not even that cheap) prices their service is just the worst I've ever experienced. I've gone on many flights and faced many delays but have always received assistance and been booked on another flight/hotel etc at the airline's expense. So I was kind of shocked when I got no assistance whatsoever. I would rather pay a little more and have the certainty of knowing I will get help if I'm stranded somewhere.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Worse than the delay was the information coming up on the board, the expected time changing and then the realisation that it was possible they could just cancel!

Lots of people had weddings to go to, tickets to the tennis etc, it's an hours flight it is not unrealistic to think getting an early am flight, you will be there for midday at least!

Ryanair service has improved in recent years, but don't expect it to be ""good"" in any sense of the word. However some of the flights are absurdly cheap. I paid 34EUR for a roundtrip flight from Barcelona to Porto, Portugal two days before departure. I can't get a roundtrip taxi cab across town for that price. You must be very careful of their tricks, especially if you're not an EU citizen. Show up early, weigh and measure your carryon, print your own boarding pass, get it stamped at the desk (if you're not from the EU), read all of the fine print and know exactly where the airports are located. They're usually very far from the city they claim to be. I once flew into ""Dusseldorf"" according to Ryanair. In reality it was a city that was a 2 hour drive from Dusseldorf. Seats are hard and cramped, food is pricey, they bombard you with advertisements throughout the flight and ground service is a joke (but improving. They no longer ""actively"" make your experience bad like they used to). You get what you pay for.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

They decided to try and book 4 flights through at the same time with 3 staff! After 2 hours stood in a queue we got to the front of the queue and again another porter came this time trying to book a disabled woman on in front of us - the woman had walked down with her husband and was sat on a chair smiling. I said to porter what are you doing? He replied booking them on! I'm stood on walking sticks and had been waiting 2 hours. So we had 15 mins left for food and toilets before boarding. The planes have no legroom, the organisation is rubbish and staff don't care less. I will never fly with them again.

The check-in process at Birmingham was perfunctory but quick, security a fairly long process as usual with inadequate staff, and boarding was fine until we stood in the airbridge for 15 minutes only to find that it was not connected anyway and so then had to descend the steps on to the ramp before going up the airstairs on the aircraft - certainly not good for the elderly and/or infirm. Similarly in Murcia, check-in was ok but long queues had formed by the time staff turned up and we were made to stand in the hot sun for 20+ minutes until the crew deigned to let us on board. At Birmingham once again no airbridge. All very convenient, I am sure, for Ryanair but not so for their customers. The cabin crew were amateur at best and seem to be there mainly to extract more cash from the passengers : all their prices are ridiculous and a claim that perfume etc is ""40% less than the high street"" is at best disingenuous. On the positive side the aircraft are clean, albeit uncomfortable, and the flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule. They do more or less what they say on the tin - but do not have any other expectations, take your own food/drink, purchase nothing and prepare to be de-humanised.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

During boarding he attempted to assist a gentleman with his baggage, attempting to place it in the first overhead bin on the right side. After some grunting and shifting of bags that were already in the bin, the cabin crew cursed outloud more than once. In addition to the lack of a filter, the cabin crew appearance was less than polished.

Mrs miserable at the 'Here to Help' counter uttered that same litany, as if we had arrived late on purpose just to annoy her - ""Check-in opens 3 hours before you fly"". Her head twitched sideways and she announced ""check-in 80' (where another long queue was waiting), then turned her back on us. When our turn finally comes after one assistant has closed up and gone home leaving only two operating, we are told we are too late and the gate is closed.

To begin with, they do not have airport check-in and boarding pass printing. Their system is based on the customer bringing his/her boarding pass ahead of time. We did not realise this, and they send us to pay 50 Euros for each ticket (for a family of 5 it was 250 Euros). Payments are done in a different ""office"", so I had to go there and stand for 20 min in a very unorganized line. When I came back to check-in the agent was very upset that we didn't pay for our suitcases, almost yelling at us. Guess what? we didn't know about this as well. So now she sent me again for the same ""office"" to pay another 200 Euros. Now, however there is only one line instead of two, so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee. Overall, their service is the worst that I've experienced. They make you feel as if they are doing you a favor for allowing you to fly their planes. I encourage anyone who wants to fly at a low cost not to fly with Ryanair. Overall it comes out to a very expensive experience.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We bought our tickets for a short domestic flight for a good price. However the ridiculous add-on charges (55x4 euros per check-in at the airport fee + 67euros for a 22 kg luggage) made it cost much much more. I understand the luggage fee. However 220 euros airport check-in fee is twice the price of our total ticket cost! Finding this cost info on their website is almost impossible (it is literally hidden on the website - you have to search for that particular thing really). Their ""don't forget to check-in online"" e-mails can easily be ignored because they don't mention any airport check-in fee. It looks like a choice, not a must-do. At least three more couple of people paid that meaningless fee. Because they were not aware of it. If this airlines were for budget travelers and really cared about customer service, they would warn travelers about those ridiculous add-on fees. A fee should offer a service, so its value should be reasonable compared with the service it gives. So we paid 220 euros for a single check-in (not four - because normal airlines do a single check-in per reservation) done by a sour-faced check-in officer who scolded us like we were little kindergarden children. This is not an acceptable service. Like another couple said on that day, ""Never again""!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Not only have Ryanair not refunded us, they haven't even replied fully to my concerns. Each time I write in, I get the same standardised response about terms and conditions.

I noticed the Ryanair desk across the hall so went over to ask when they were opening the other 2 check in desks, they said they didn't intend to. I explained we were worried about missing the flight and were told, once you are checked in the flight will wait for you? Anyway about 1hour 30 mins later we finally got our bags checked in then we ran to the next stage, bear in mind we had 3 OAP's and an 8 year old to deal with so running isn't exactly an option. We were told to empty all contents into the little boxes and go through security. After 40 minutes we got through security only to realise they were calling last boarding call for our flight. Our flight was at the end of the terminal, (when aren't they) so we had to leg it as fast as we could, now again, 3 OAP's me on crutches and an 8 year old trying to run through EMA to catch a flight that we had queued up for ages to get. Given that we did finally manage to get on board, I would not recommend either EMA airport or Ryanair for future travel. I would rather pay an additional charge to fly from another airport with another company. If there was an option for 0/10 I would give it zero.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We were traveling around Germany and Spain and didn't have access to computer printer, unaware of their policy. I've traveled the world and never heard of anything like that. They herd them in like cattle. There is basically no service and you pay extra for everything. Flight was late which almost caused us to miss connecting flight.

There is no pocket to store your items such as your phone etc, this is the stupidest thing I have ever seen on a commercial aircraft, the seats are filthy - there was chewing gum stuck to the seats in front of us and certain parts of the chairs in front of us had a lot of dirt on them. Window seats are really uncomfortable I could not sleep because I had nowhere to rest my head as the seats are flat and comparable to rocks. This is the only airline that flys from Zadar to Dublin so we had no other choice and I understand it is a low cost airline - however, other low cost airlines at least clean their seats and provide a pocket for your stuff. We plan to never fly with them again as we are taking a flight from Belfast with easyJet to Split which is closer to our location in which we stay in.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The flight was again without incident, but the standards of aircraft interior are now much lower than say the easyJet flight I took 2 weeks prior.

I again entered all info for our family of 8 and the website timed me out. I tried again, saving the info as I went along but their system does not allow saves. Again, timed out with an ‘error’ page. At check in we explained to a Ryanair agent what happened. She rudely told us this was not their problem and we had to pay extra. We were sent to pay for one bag and a check-in fee, amounting to $630Cdn, more than the price of 8 flights! We were told if we prove an ‘error’ page on the computer they would refund. We showed them the error page. They wouldn’t accept it there and forced us to pay up front then call customer service for a refund. We did, and received a stock email and refused us a refund. Everyone we dealt with had a superior couldn’t care less attitude. They lied about a refund being possible. As a business owner, this kind of service appalls me.

As I have read previously, had to pay for returning seats as couldn't print boarding pass until we arrived at holiday resort. So found this all a rip off.

However, the currency rate they use to charge you is different from the official rate! Which leads you to think you are paying X, but you are actually paying X + 100. In the end the flight cost me as much as full service airline, but I got the worst service. I did not get a glass of water on my international flight with Ryanair. I emailed them about 15 times before the flight to explain there was a problem with the amount they were charging, which was a totally different amount. To add a bag on the website is supposed to be 45 euros, but they charge 56 euros, I never understood that, and they never answered why. Their replies were nonsense emails not answering my questions. At the airport I found out why, because their ruddest staff had the courage to say ""You chose to fly Ryanair, so you have to pay as much as we say it is.""","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I anticipated a delay from Palma and so I was not surprised when we took off almost two hours past our due time. At Palma, after having our boarding passes checked, we then went into the glass walkway to the aircraft and stood waiting in the same place to board. This glass walkway was in the full sun with people using anything for a fan and given no reason for this. I was very concerned for my baby granddaughter who was sweating profusely and we were in this situation for approximately 15 minutes. Why did that happen, could we not have been held back in the departure lounge. It was appalling and of course no offer of any water. On the flight there were members of staff, or I assume they were, who were helping uniformed staff but one was in shorts and t-shirt and the other casually dressed. To state sloppy is an understatement, it was appalling. These flight were not cheap as they were in the peak summer period so no consolation there. Appalling","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I was surprised despite the reviews. I dont think the reviews are fair. The terms regarding boarding passes are clear and the technology savvy can easily find out this information. I see one review about using apps to check in with other airlines, so why such a tech block with Ryanair? They have an app, it reminds you of your flight even without, and the email in gmail tells you to check in (gives a link) follow the link and it tells you to print, or download boarding pass. Anyway, extremely efficient. Which was wonderful with 3 kids in tow. I cannot complain whatsoever. The luggage was not a problem again you just have to be savvy and dont try to go over just incase. But in my opinion unless you've got gold bars in the allocated sized bag there's no way. I put all my heavies in the 2nd bag.

The check-in clerk however could benefit from a refresher course in customer service as he appeared extremely bored and disinterested. However my complaint starts when we did not print off our return boarding passes in advance of the holiday and although we tried to reserve our seats for the return flight, so my family could sit together we were unable to do this via their web-site. We gave up after 2 attempts and assumed we would check-in on arrival and take whatever seats available. We of course were not aware that they would be an additional charge for printing a boarding pass and was advised by the desk clerk to check-in on-line, again we tried to do this via our smart phone but again were unable to access the booking on the web-site. As we had spent a considerable amount of time and with mounting stress from my wife, I was forced to pay the additional charge. The 3 boarding passes were duly hand written in 10 minutes by the Servisair clerk and 135€ extracted. The clerk even told us we were lucky to get the last 3 seats even though we had booked and paid for them. I find these charges levied by Ryanair are totally disproportionate to the administration involved and are punitive in the extreme and are extracted under stressful circumstances. Up to this point we had enjoyed a fabulous holiday only to have it spoiled on our return. I have a number of issues with this penalty charge, firstly; it is not clear on their web-site when making the on-line seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight (or is it Ryanair’s intention to catch out the new customers?) and secondly, I regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes. I regularly use on-line booking and the barcode via smart phone but generally this is within 24 hours prior to departure and I have never been charged for a boarding pass, this is not the industry norm. I made a complaint to Ryanair and got a stock answer hiding behind the T&C's and no refund. Still valuable albeit expensive lesson learned never to fly Ryanair again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

However, very pleasantly surprised. Hand baggage only and online check-in worked superbly. Upon arrival at gate, boarding was speedy and professional, thats all that is required. All boarded on time, but then informed of approximately 1 hour delay to ATC in Spain. Not the airlines fault and Captain continually updated us. In fact his best update was yet to come. Finally departed bit sooner than originally informed. Inflight service again professional and courteous. Yes, prices can be slightly high, but they are on trains too, but not too over priced, in my opinion. Certainly was no strong selling on this flight. Further delay as we approached Palma, this time due to the weather, but again superbly informed and updated by the pilot, who made sure to tell us we had enough fuel of course. Eventually arrived approximately 1 hour late, into a torrential downpour, thankfully to a stand and not a remote stand with bus trip. I was impressed with Ryanair and indeed the little comments and humour from the flight deck ensured that though we were delayed, not due to Ryanair actions, probably made the experience less stressful than it could have been, I have now become a fan and would use once again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We joined the line with one medium case we had paid to put in the hold and one cabin sized case. A Ryanair representative approached us and told us we could put our small case in the hold for free, I explained it had my medication in and that I would prefer to keep it with me in the cabin, she became quite annoyed with me when I refused to take up the offer. We were again hassled when going through the gate but with courtesy this time. The staff on the plane were all very professional and made the flight enjoyable both flying out and back again. On our journey home we downloaded our boarding passes electronically and it was much easier than printing it.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We had been backpacking for two weeks and were unable to print boarding passes. In Dublin, when I approached the desk to say that we had our boarding passes on a laptop, the customer service worker starting yelling at us. ""How am I supposed to stamp your boarding pass if it's on a device?"" So we got in another line and got our boarding passes printed but felt shaken that we'd just been screamed at (even though the 'save as pdf' option was clearly one of the options during online checkin and there was no warning about needing passes on paper). On the return from Edinburgh to Dublin, we still had not been able to print passes and were told it would be GBP15 per person to print the boarding cards. It was infuriating and felt like highway robbery. And then you get on board and they charge for the coffee and sell lotto tickets to benefit some children's charity.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Both flights were on-time and the crew were friendly. Only the boarding process is a bit strange as you have to wait quite a long time standing in a line even before the aircraft has actually landed. This kind of boarding process makes their new priority boarding unnecessary. Overall I would recommend flying Ryanair.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The furthest gate at ALC, but boarding was efficient, so was a mystery as to why we waited so long to depart. Seat was fairly comfortable, but anymore than a few hours would be the opposite effect. Still perplexed with the rationale of no magazine unless you ask for one (and its not common knowledge); as soon as the beverage service commences, its a guess as to what's on offer. Nice tea and generous with the milk at least. Cabin crew were friendly and approachable, and the Captain was informative. Flight was delayed by around thirty minutes, but at least it avoided the recorded fanfare on arrival.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Long queue to check in luggage, thankfully we arrived 2hrs 30 mins early, had just enough time to drop luggage - which was literally that as already checked in online and downloaded boarding passes, find the gate and board. Told my 3 and6 yr old we would get a snack and drink onboard. Only problem was they had nO soft drinks or water for the girls and limited snacks. When we asked what we should give the girls to drink, the air steward advised red bull! Otherwise they had tomato juice! Apparently the inbound flight from Ibiza sold more than anticipated and they are not allowed to restock. I'm paying for it, it should be available and it's not like I was expecting it complimentary. I also found the staff rude and unwilling to assist.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Ryanair is like a bus. You pay a small fare and they get you where you want to go. The cabin was not luxurious nor was it as clean as a British Airways one but we didn't expect it to be. Didn't love having the safety card stuck at eye-level on the seat in front but again, this is a budget airline. Had a very quick taxi and takeoff from Stagnated which was great and the landing at Krakow was smooth. Great pilots. Love the comical fanfare as you touchdown. Disembarking the plane was quick and we were with our reserved taxi within 20 minutes. On the way back we chose priority boarding which i would very much recommend, especially when its an evening flight and you just want to get home. Overall very satisfied with the service Ryanair provided.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We are a family of 4, I have a 9 year old daughter and 5 year old son. This airline expected my 5 year old to sit on his own at the front of the plane and my 9 year daughter to sit at the back. No one wanted to help or give me answer to the fact by law there not allowed to fly without a parent but yet you feel it's ok to separate my children from their mother. In the end a passenger actually moved so I could sit with my young children, if he hadn't my daughter would have been made to sit in the corner with 2 men who actually got really drunk and had to be spoken to on several occasions. I was told it's all to do with balance I've never heard anything so ridiculous. On the return flight we had to pay an additional amount to insure the safety of my children, I think this is a disgrace, we paid for our flights and shouldn't have to pay more. It's common sense to put young children with their parents.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Check in easy at MAN, no hassles over cabin bag sizes and the hassles and stress seemed more passenger driven than airline provoked. Didn't join the queue 60 minutes early at the gate, not only were we assigned seats together, we also got overhead room easily as well. Flights a bit late but that's European air travel. Crew fine and we were in the STR rental car building in 25 minutes on arrival. On return STR didn't inspire with cold war security and check-in chaos but FR honoured our seats and we strolled on 10 minutes before departure. Nice coffee and informative FO pointed out sights.

Again rude cabin crew and the flight was delayed for around 1.5 hrs whilst seated inside the plane. Drinks were offered as it was quite stuffy and to the amazement of passengers, they were charging for this. The captain announced that we would be taxiing in 8 minutes and to go to the lavatories if one needs to. I went to the loo and was told to get back to my seat by a rude air hostess.

Seeing other passengers approach a separate window that appeared to be there to sell tickets or collect overcharges, I approached, showed my passport and boarding pass and asked if I needed to remain in the check in queue. That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat. The flight attendant walked by and asked that I store the hand bag I had with me in the overhead as it was an exit row. Priority boarding was relaxed and more civilized. Print boarding pass before you get to the airport. If you printed your boarding pass, you can go directly to the gate. I was able to check in my rolling bag for free because the flight was nearly full and there was need for overhead space. Weigh your hand luggae and ensure it is within the rules. Spend the money and reserve a priority seat. It makes a huge difference.","","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_13371-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_09711-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_09731-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0975-50x50.jpg","; ; ; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_13371-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_09711-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_09731-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0975-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_13371-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_09711-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_09731-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_0975-500x500.jpg","; ; ; ","Aircraft

Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance. Ryanair certainly seems to be more passenger-friendly these days but it is still advisable to be aware of the rules to avoid any possible pitfalls.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

However, recently decided to give it a shot as they fly direct to Marrakech. I was impressed with their website and ease of use. I managed to prebook seats, luggage, check in online etc. It's a no frills airline but you are paying such great prices so you cannot complain. The cabin crew were friendly and did a good job on board. The only negative comment I can say is that they had ran out of Prosecco (except for 1 bottle) on both flights and we were sitting in Row 3! The bar seemed poorly stocked and on the return flight I heard that there was no hot food available. I am not surprised as the passengers were only getting off our aircraft 5 minutes before we boarded it to return home. I never saw an aircraft turned around so quickly in all my years of travel. A big plus was no lost baggage and everything arrived home in one piece, including delicate pottery souvenirs etc.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Hundreds of people fighting to check bags, took over one hour and twenty five minutes to get to check bags. They kept putting people in front of us who had arrived late. After check in we had to fight and push our way through a grid lock for security , then ran like mad people through the crowd just making the aircraft before gates closed. I have never experienced anything lie it before. After paying for baggage, I think British Airways would have been cheaper, considering had to make our way to and from Stanstead as well.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair. Very disappointing.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Cheap tickets that add up quickly with luggage etc.. Their customer service is hard to get a hold of, no one in the airport until 2 hours before the flight. Also once you find them it is almost comical how bad their customer service is. I asked police at the airport about how long the security lines are since I found out I was not getting checked in until 2 hours before and they were puzzled because other airlines usually do it 3 hours before and they asked which airline and once I said Ryanair they smiled and said ""of course.""","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We still had over 1.5 hours. So, we waited in line at customer service for almost an hour and was told that we owed them £20 for 2 Kilos. I informed her that it was 2 bags not 2 kilos. so, we were sent back to the baggage line to get the correct form. We went to front of line as instructed and crowd was unhappy. Our agent had left. But, we got the correct form and returned to front of customer service line, crowd was unhappy, and was told that it would be £400, that is almost $800 US dollars for 2 bags. We tried to sort that out but to no avail. We were told to read the small print over and over. So, I agreed to pay and was told it was too late, that the flight was closed. So, we had to buy new tickets on another airline at another airport.

We chose Ryanair for its low fares. The numerous fees exceeded the original cost of our tickets. While some fees are warranted, Ryanair is the only airline I have flown that charges fees to print out boarding passes. Their excess baggage weight fees are higher as well. Even more troubling is the disorganized check in and bag drop-off process and unacceptable customer service. We had to stand in one long line to drop off checked bags, another line to pay extra fees and return to the 1st line to complete the bag drop process. During this ordeal, we were met with staff who were insolent (berating us in French) and clearly had no allegiance to Ryanair (giving confusing directions). Ryanair has a lot to learn about efficiency and customer service if it wants to be the Southwest Airlines of Europe. Until then, we will fly other airlines, even if the fares are higher.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I understand that a lot of people go to Ibiza to party but so do a lot travel for family holidays - it was like a party plane. There was no control of the travellers who congregated in the aisles, sat 4 to a row (3 seats) sat on arm rests, music played loudly in the row in front of us (and not good music at that). The trolley of drinks and snacks was pointless on both the flight there and back as after a few rows there was nothing left (we were in row 14) the seatbelt light was put on half way through our flight out there when there was no turbulence - I believe this was to try and seat people but when my husband attempted to take my 5 year old daughter to the toilet (whilst others were still stood I have to add) a member of staff was slightly rude and told us she couldn't go and had to sit down. Shortly after this the light was turned off.

It was odd that the airport did not announce departure gate numbers until an hour beforehand, but it wasn't a big deal. I personally enjoyed doing some shopping and getting a bit to eat before heading to the gate. The boarding was fairly effortless, although Ryanair did not call us by seat number. This resulted in a big bulge of customers at the start of boarding, so we just sat back down and waited. The flight was on-time, We had a pleasant, short flight to Cork. Cork Airport was beautiful and it didn't look like there were many flights arriving that time - our visit through customs was brief and very friendly. It was a pleasant trip and a very inexpensive one too. Our family will definitely fly with Ryanair again!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Apparently Ryanair is having a labor dispute with it's baggage handlers at MAD airport. Consequently no baggage was carried on that route and I was not informed until 2 days before the flight. I was already in Europe and my bag was too large to fit in an overhead luggage compartment. I had to privately ship my bag to MAD at a much greater cost and received only the baggage charge refund. Ryanair is not a customer friendly airline. If anything goes wrong you are left to your own devices to find a solution.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

You don't expect much from a flight with low prices. Staff seem disinterested and lack enthusiasm for their job. Inflight food is extortionate and not worth the money. Beware that unless you are in the first half of passengers at the gate then you are unlikely to be able to take your cabin baggage onboard with you and will have to put it in the hold.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We booked with Ryanair after a long time of not using them after previous bad experiences but saw the new website and various other newly replaced items and services that Ryanair use and bought tickets for return flights to Tenerife. However easier the prepayment section of the booking experience and website may be we found that once you had played the airline used all sorts of dirty tricks such as making you pay for allocated seating if you wanted to make sure your party was sitting together and charging for all sorts of other service that would be expected to be provided freely. This made the flights no cheaper than the ones that other airlines offered. The cabin - despite pictures on the internet - looked gloomy, old fashioned and dirty. Onboard food as overpriced and service was slow. The cabin crew were constantly pushing you to buy products as they are partially payed on commission. Also the main reason Ryanair is usually on time is that unlike other airlines they add an additional 10 minutes onto the actual estimated flight time.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Excellent value and only travelled with cabin baggage. Due to the time of year I assumed the flights would be busy so asked at the Bag Drop desks at both Glasgow and Dublin if they could accept by bag into the hold, which they did free of charge and with no fuss. GLA-DUB flight was slightly late due to the aircraft arriving late into Glasgow, but the next sector was on time, arriving 10 minutes early. Both flights typical Ryanair, the service being consistent. Crew on the DUB-BRE sector had more time to chat and appeared efficient. Bags arrived on time at each airport and pre-booked seats worked well. I like the calmer boarding atmosphere that allocated seating brings.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Boarding was slightly chaotic due to simultaneous departing flights to the UK, but this was not Ryanair's issue, being within the control of the airport authorities. The cabin crew were very welcoming, especially the cabin supervisor. She appeared efficient and along with the rest of the crew seemed to go out of her way to chat to as many passengers as possible when the opportunity arose. The crew were humorous in their charity scratchcard sales pitch and the flight arrived in Edinburgh around 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Very good value for money and a useful route between Scotland and this part of northern Germany. Would definitely use again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Both flights were more or less on time, and the outward boarding was quite smooth. The bad. On the outward flight awful overpriced food was offered and there were 2 ‘scratch card runs ‘. On a two and a half hour flight? There being no on board magazine or duty free menu is it any wonder nobody buys any duty free goods – nobody has any idea what is for sale. At the end of the flight there was no thanks or goodbye as we left the plane the first time in 35 years I have ever had this. The two cabin crew by the rear doors totally ignored the departing passengers whilst chatting in their own language. Very unprofessional cabin crew that day. On the journey back the cabin crew were much better. There was only one scratchcard run and one hard sell on the breakfast lasagne that ‘melted in your mouth ‘. No thanks. Our real issue as we were waiting in the queue (towards the back) to embark a ground staff came up the line and attached yellow stickers to our hand luggage and boarding pass. She spoke no English, and we eventually worked out our hand luggage (which was all we had by choice) was now going in the hold. This was a bit of a disaster for us as we were now being forced to wait at the baggage reclaim at the other end , a wait which proved to be about half an hour meaning we overshot out car parking time and had to pay excess. Despite this sticker business some people behind us in the queue were removing the stickers prior to embarking and just taking the luggage on the plane anyway. But we played the game and tried to safeguard some delicate stuff we had. Despite this on arrival home we found that some articles were damaged, something that should never have happened in the first place. So, in a nutshell if you are prepared to forsake everything for a cheap flight Ryanair are the best in the business. If the travelling is a big part of your trip, avoid them like the plague. We will be in future and have decided never again. There are deals out there on decent airlines.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Whilst in the queue to board a member of staff tagged my hand luggage and boarding pass with yellow stickers. I was just over half way down the queue. All the people around me were being tagged so thought nothing of it. On boarding I moved to my seat half way along the plane. A member of the crew who was stood near to my seat told me my bag should've been left at the entrance and put in the hold. I had at no point before this been told to do so. The aisle was rammed with passengers but she still wanted me to take my bag off the plane. After much discussion I persuaded her to let me put my bag in the overhead where there was plenty of space and I would remove it if necessary. I sat and watched many more passengers board who had arrived much later than me (no stickers on their bags) as it happened there was plenty of space in the lockers so my bag stayed put. I had booked hand luggage only as I needed to be out of the airport quickly. My bag was not oversized and I was nowhere near the back of the queue for boarding. I am not happy that I was made to feel so uncomfortable in front of other passengers.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Well this was supposed to be the date at 4.30pm. This was then delayed an hour. So it gets to 5.30pm and off I go to board, all good lets us board the plane. Once everyone is on they then announce there is a technical issue and leave us on a hot plane for 1.5 hrs. They then tell us the flight is cancelled and we need to disembark. Arrange another flight for us at 8.45pm. So we are waiting around for hours with a £3.50 voucher provided for food and drink. Anyone that knows airports knows that this would get you a bottle of water if your lucky! So take 2 go to board for the 8.45pm flight, get to the gate and even though the plane is there they tell us we are not going and no explanation as to why. We then have to go and collect any luggage and when I ask if there is any news get rudely told to go ""stand over there!"" Finally they arrange to get us taxi's to a local hotel. Well 6 taxi's for a whole flight took quite a lot of time. It's midnight by the time I get there and the front desk tell us we need to be ready for 5am. So get to the airport for 5am, the flight is then put back an hour. Finally time to board and not a member of staff in sight, they finally arrive at 8.30 and start to board us. Once everyone is on board we then have to sit there to wait for ""paperwork"" and then another passenger. Finally we leave after 9.30am but are then told there are no drinks or food on board. Now these things happen when flying but it was the total lack of care or empathy from the staff and the lack of communication that was the absolute worst.

I was accompanied by a group of 10 people at the same situation. Gate was already closed and Ryanair clerk informed us that they cannot risk any delays for those who are late. So far so good, best came at their so called ""Customer service"" point where pleasant clerk advised me to take Taxi and not to take train next time. Thank you Ryan for that piece of really valuable advise. Next time I am not going to take Ryanair in the first place.

Ryanair in 2015, simply do not deserve the reputation they have. The entire booking process was easy to understand and administer. Follow the rules and it works well and easy. The flight itself was bang on time, smooth and a joy. A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old. I think that all Ryanair need to do now to complete their transformation to a customer friendly carrier, is make water affordable on board. Perhaps £1 for a 500ml bottle of water wouldn't be too much to ask?","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours. It was appalling and could have escalated into something nasty all due to the bad customer service from Ryanair. I also witnessed an elderly disabled passenger become very distressed when she learned she could not take her collapsible walking aid onto the plane even though she'd been told in advance that she could.

I read all the small print and rules to be able to pay the correct price for bag fast boarding and emergency row seat. These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control. My bag was already on the belt I was off the airport 20 minutes after landing. Absolutely bearable experience; you'll have no trouble if you carefully read their instruction and spend extra 10 minutes on booking process. Also expect to pay twice of announced lowest price online to avoid airport charges.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We arrived on time we had our boarding passes ready we took our seats the flight was good no turbulence. Captain provided updates to passengers multiple times during our short flight. I don't understand previous complaints about printing boarding passes. This is their policy it is clearly stipulated on their web. they have good prices one just need to follow their terms and conditions. As a reward you will get cheap flight tickets very simple. Also you can have two cabin bags with you for free. Just be sure they fit the cabin bag dimensions. Italian crew checked all the passengers cabin bags this never happened to me in England or Slovakia.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I've opted to avoid Ryanair for the last five years preferring to travel on full-service airlines from central airports for a little more money. However in this instance Ryanair offered the easiest best times connection from Edinburgh to Vienna (well Bratislava). I paid £8 for seat 1C (extra leg room and priority boarding) and £15 to check in a bag online the day before departure. Bag drop at Edinburgh was efficient. On time departure friendly staff quick flight early arrival can't complain. Apart from the lousy dry cheese sandwiches and drinks you get on Lufthansa/Austrian the difference was minimal. So well done Ryanair.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We were firstly informed that a delay of 1.5 hours was estimated. After a while we were informed that another 1 hour had been added. So all passengers sat on the plane for 2.5 hours. Our first complaint - Sitting in a stationary hot metal tube for 2.5 hours is not my idea of enjoyment particularly when nobody was offered even the smallest drink of complimentary cold water in order to alleviate the discomfort. During the 2.5 hour delay there would have been time to have some water delivered. The irony in all of this is that shortly after take-off the cabin crew came round selling drinks. Our second complaint - Flight FR9015 Thursday 7th May - El Prat to Stansted. Taking advantage of the 10kg on board baggage allowance + small bag we purchased a second ""carry on"" cabin bag (size within stipulated regulation). On the outward journey not a problem. A different story on the return flight though. On entry to the plane I was told by a Stewardess ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I explained that we had no problems on the outward journey the cabin crew were quite happy. Not being convinced she repeated the statement ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I again repeated my statement and then went to take my seat and stow my cabin bag. Little knowing that my wife was behind me she said again in a rather snide voice ""That is not a cabin bag!"" Not wanting to cause an argument my wife just reiterated the fact that it was acceptable on the outward journey. So in summation we have a rather dim view of Ryanair. Booking of future holidays will take into consideration who the airline carrier is and if it is Ryanair we will attempt to make alternative arrangements.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The airport teams are efficient to the point of being distant/abrupt while the flight teams are busying and friendly. Altogether I find Ryanair best of the low-budgets. However its constant and repetitious announcements inflight could really improve. On Stansted-Karlsruhe there were 11 announcements before take-off and 11 during the one-hour flight (22 announcements within 75 mins!). The content covered safety refreshments and fund-raising. On 5 of these occasions when the announcement was the first time announced it began ""Once again...."" on 7 occasions the completely unnecessary request was to ""sit back relax and enjoy the flight"". Am I the only person who finds this really irritating?","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Good price more competitively priced now than Easyjet hence deciding to travel with them instead. Flight left a little late but made up for the delay in the air and landed on time. Cabin basic and not particularly clean- we literally passed the departing passengers from our plane across the tarmac so obviously no time there to clean the plane - however if speedy turnaround keeps costs down I can put up with a few crumbs. Did not pay for allocated seating but got two decent seats one by the window. If they reduced allocated seating costs I might have considered it. Return flight also bang on time leaving and arrived early. Pilots friendly and informative although very difficult to hear as engines seemed much noisier than other airlines. Staff were definitely not as friendly as other airlines rolling eyes at passengers etc which is a shame as being cheap shouldn't mean poorer customer service. I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge. Overhead lockers were completely crammed with massive hand luggage items. All in all does what it says on the tin - got us there and back alive and well on time at a good price.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The experience was horrible. I think the check-in and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a European or UK passport. If you need to check in a bag or you require a visa it's absolute chaos. There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me.

I have never been a fan of this airline but I have to admit they are moving forward and slowly getting closer to what I consider to be an enjoyable carrier to fly with (for short haul flights). Flew BGY to SKG last week for a short Greek holiday with no issue at all: on time departures/arrivals good rate for the ticket and above all some improvements I did notice compared to the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. The main one is of course the seat allocation for everyone which prevent people from rushing to the aircraft as if it was a bus school trip. I also found seat comfort and legroom to have improved and even the cabin crew seems a bit more professional and friendly now even if they still talk too much in my opinion during the flight to try and sell whatever the can to the passengers. Another positive news is that there is no longer (at least according to my experience) an obsessive check of your hand baggage dimensions and weight at the gate which I do appreciate. Generally speaking if you check the rules carefully and comply with them you can get a great value for money as well as good and frequent direct connections. The day they stop boarding the plane half an hour before the plane is actually ready to welcome passengers onboard (thus causing people to wait on the stairs/bus/apron for up to 15 minutes) they will probably see me much more often on their planes.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The maitre d' shouted and yelled and my son who expressed his concern regarding fresh air and cooler air temperature in the cabin. Ryanair is a budget airline and I'm aware of that but budget does not mean poor maintenance and rude and unfriendly flight crew. As a very frequent airline passenger I must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day.

As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

CCF to STN return. Surprised to be allocated the same back row seat for both flights even though I'd not paid for seat choice. I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? £4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative. Happily nowadays I'm quite keen to recommend them to anyone on any route if getting from A to B in the shortest time for the least money including bags etc is a priority.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I travelled recently to Rome and this was a very poor experience - the flights were late the customer service was very poor and the cabins filthy. The yellow tagging farce is actually funny to watch - the policy as I was rudely told is the ""first 90 bags"" however it was totally random with customers with large trolley bags walking through and then other customers behind them being tagged?! There is no correct monitoring system for this whatsoever so you are at the mercy of the poorly trained staff on the gate. You then get onto the flight to find several spaces in the overhead lockers and several empty seats! Quite frankly I am fed up with the continual poor service so I have now booked with Aer Lingus for my next trip to Dublin. I am also at the stage where I will actually pay a higher fare in order to have a relaxed experience with well trained staff who smile instead or a rude and grumpy scripted person who cannot answer anything outside of that script.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

No food left only chocolate snacks and crisps staff seemed as if they didn't know what they was doing slow and no organisation started from the front of the plane and we was at the back row 33. So not much left anyway but no sandwiches at the front of the plane as was sold out on the flight out. Very cramped. Paid for seats going out and to put a case in the hold (£60) return what a rip off. But refused to pay for seats to come back. Will not travel with them again if I can help it.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Always chose another airline if I had the choice but back to Ryanair after this flight. 10 euros for an emergency exit seat were well spent on this 2.20 hrs flight. Very professional and polite crew smooth flight and on time performance. I like the fact that you can check in 30 days before departure when you reserve a seat. Big plus for people complaining they can't print their boarding passes while on holiday. Or use the app and store in pass book. No paper needed. The airports added to discomfort however: Eindhoven is too small for six Ryanair flight departing within 1.5 hrs and in Porto the baggage reclaim took half an hour.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It was on time and I only had carry on luggage only and had printed off a boarding pass beforehand and as always if you play their game it all works well. The flight was only £40 and considering I had driven the first leg at a cost of £200 I have no idea how they manage to provide flights so cheaply. The cabin crew did their best but there was no milk for drinks or inflight magazines which was a bit of a disaster and raised a laugh with the passengers (well some of them with a sense of humour) and of course out came the dreaded scratch cards at the end of the flight but the plane was clean on time and I was happy with my trip and will use them again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have flown with Ryanair before on short flights from Glasgow to Dublin which were fine (although had us standing outside in the freezing cold waiting to board for 20 minutes). Faro to Glasgow was a 3 hour flight and I am 6 months pregnant. I had to drag my suitcase up the stairs to board the plane and stand waiting there for a good 10 minutes until other passengers had taken their seats. When we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. My husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. During this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. Menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didn't have enough to go round. It was a lunchtime flight and I was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if I could buy a panini. I was told they had ran out (again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats). No alternative was offered. The staff looked tired and fed up. Also there was a hen do on board with one idiot randomly shouting at the top of her voice. I didn't see any cabin crew addressing this. I would only fly Ryanair for very short flights if desperate. Will avoid in future and would certainly not recommend when over 3 months pregnant! Appalling.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Although a few weeks before I received notice that the flight time had changed which required some workarounds in my own schedule in addition to the flight ultimately being delayed. Although everything was acceptable in general I also rather didn't like how non-EU/EEA citizens have to go to the bag drop line for visa checks which took an additional 30 minutes before going through security simply because the line was so long. I also realized the seats do not recline I'm not sure if this was because of the route or if all their aircraft are like this in general but I definitely would not want to go on a long flight with them if this were the case!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow. On the whole though I don't mind flying FR once you know what you're at and what to expect then you shouldn't have a major issue.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The gate crew and on-board crew were all friendly cheery and helpful the plane itself was surprisingly comfortable (muchmore comfortable than the United 757s we flew to/from Dublin the week before) and on-board food and beverage choices were decent and not horribly pricey. We departed promptly on time arrived on time and getting on/off was efficiently managed by the crew. Nearly everyone else on our flight was part of a huge school trip (kids about 12-14 plus their ""keepers"") and the crew members were great with the kids - kept them as organized as possible and were flexible about changing seat assignments so that friends could sit together - very nice to see! Here are the only two reasons I didn't give Ryanair an overall ""10"" rating: 1) I received mobile-phone alerts reminding me to do online check-in and get mobile boarding passes. Sounds easy enough but after four tries I was still unable to input our information - no explanation given. Finally on the fifth try it worked: I added all of the requested info (passport numbers etc.) for our party and then got a message saying ""We are unable to issue mobile boarding passes"" - again no explanation at all. Since I didn't have access to a computer or printer I began to panic especially after reading that there was a fee of 70 pounds per person to check in at the airport! Thank heavens our B&B owner came to the rescue and offered me the use of his personal computer and printer to complete the online check-in and print boarding passes. 2) We arrived at Stansted with more than two hours to spare before our flight got through security in record time and began checking the boards to see which gate we'd depart from. We sat down in the Coast to Coast restaurant to grab brunch while waiting all the while keeping an eye on the Departures board but out gate number wasn't posted until 15 minutes before departure time! Worse it turned out that our gate was a nearly 10-minute walk from the restaurant so all of on this flight had to do a mad dash for the gate at (almost) the last minute. I've never ever seen a gate number posted so late in the game especially when the gate was fairly far away - that was just baffling. Other than those two glitches however the Ryanair flight was a great deal for the money and I'd certainly fly them again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

After being kept waiting she eventually told us that some coaches were being arranged what happened to the one that were a few minutes away?

I didn't expect much from low-cost so I wasn't disappointed in any sense. The flight was from Gdansk to Stansted. I purchased priority service and 15 kg hold bag allowance. At check in desk they spent 5 minutes checking my documents since not many non-eu travelers use this service. They even printed me a ""conventional"" boarding pass. At the gate there was an expected 15 min wait in a crowd on the stairs leading to apron. Not pleasant for parents with crying children all around but bearable for solo traveler. A short walk to the plane then got to my seat. Since it was an exit seat can't say anything about standard legroom. What I had was fine. No seat recline. The seat was ok. Announcements were not noisy. Flight took off late and landed before schedule. I didn't buy anything onboard. Long walk on arrival. Bag on the belt when I was off the immigration. Don't have an idea what if things went wrong but what I got for my money was predictable and trouble free. Other options from Gdansk to London were Wizzair known for carry-on charges or conventional airlines with higher prices and transfers at major hubs. I preferred direct service. If took 2 hours and 68 USD to take me from G to L.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Whilst the cost is reasonable to be honest it wasn't worth it. I didn't take luggage so no cost benefit to me. At Stansted I did get through security about 10 minutes quicker. Priority boarding going out was standing on the Tarmac for longer. The return from Morocco didn't give me any benefits as whilst the priority boards were first onto the bus to get to the plane everyone else was on the bus so we had to stand in a long queue. I do feel you should provide a hot drink and a snack at least as part of the package. Regardless of this the staff as always are helpful and kind. This experience won't put me off using Ryanair but may just stick to economy as the business cost is too much for too little.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

With any other airline landing cards are offered to persons like myself during the flight. This saves time filling it out later at customs. However they are never offered on Ryanair. On a recent flight home from Gdansk I decided to ask the crew for a card since I figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. The crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in Arabic half in French which appeared to be for passengers arriving in Morocco. It was completely different to the standard form. Later in the flight I spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. She giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it 'just in case.' I pointed out that she was not making any sense. How hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight? If this is for some reason not possible then perhaps the staff need better training in terms of what to do if a passenger request one. Perhaps they could simply tell the passenger 'sorry we do not carry those on-board.' The whole episode was just silly.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

However the purchasing of tickets is laborious and time consuming. The cost of the flights easily double should you reserve a seat (standard elsewhere) or want to stow luggage in the hold (standard elsewhere). The cabin crew were unbelievably poor and one even had a broken shoe ripped trousers un-ironed shirt and jacket and tie that was thrown on. Looked like he had been pulled through a hedge backwards - never seen anything like it. About to start the onerous process again for this years holiday as flying locally is great but oh why don't they just try to raise their standards they should be ashamed of their business as it stands.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Calculating a 5 hour delay I immediately asked to be disembarked - the capt responded immediately arranging stairs and ground crew. In minutes we were off with helpful crew around. As we entered the terminal the airport announced closure and the flight delayed by 90 minutes plus. Fact was it departed 4 hours 46 minutes later. We cancelled our seats.

Eventually it arrived and we were called to await boarding. We were then told to cross the tarmac to the plane for boarding. However when we reached the plane we were not allowed to board. There was a barrier over both entrances to the plane. The whole plane-load of passengers were kept outside on the tarmac in windy freezing conditions for about 15 minutes. There were babes in arms tiny children and elderly people standing outside a plane we had been given permission to board in freezing conditions. People in the queues were shouting to be allowed to board to no avail. When I returned home I wrote to Ryanair: requesting an explanation as to why passengers were called to board before the plane was ready when the plane was parked just outside the Airport buildings and also asking that the explanation be passed on to all adult passengers aboard that flight. I thought that would be the very least they could do. Ryanair sent an acknowledgement of my letter saying they were looking into the matter and I have not heard from Ryanair since.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This route hasn't appeared for 2015 and having contacted the airline all it can say is ""keep looking"". This simply isn't good enough. Ryanair will know already if it will operate this route this year. I suspect they want passengers to book alternative routes but Stansted really isn't an alternative for us. We live in Staffordshire and petrol plus car park fees would cost more than the price of the flights. Come on Ryanair.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I can get to many European destinations for less than the price of a return train ticket to London (just 50 miles away from where I live).

The night before our flight out of Malaga I duly went online to the Ryanair website to do the Online Check In. I filled in the flight details and submitted it then there was on option to print the Boarding Pass however I didn't have a printer my apartment so I assumed that since I had submitted the details all would be fine. This was not the case however. On arrival at Malaga Airport the next day we went to the Ryanair check in point that was at least 100 metres away from any other check in desk (probably so that other passengers could not hear any passenger complaints) We were asked for our Boarding Passes. I said that he had checked in online but had no way of printing the Boarding Pass. The Ryanair representative said that her computer was not showing that the Online Check In had been done. Although I insisted that I had submitted the Check In form online there was no way that I could prove it. The Ryanair Online Check In requires that the submit button is clicked on numerous times as it wants to sell extra luggage allowance hotels car hire and selected seats. If the submit button is not clicked on by-passing each of these selection options then the Online Check In does not go through. The Ryanair representative said that we would have to pay 70 Euros each for not submitting the Online Check In and for printing the Boarding Passes but as an alternative we were then told to take our laptop to the Ryanair Information Desk where they could have 15 minutes of free use of the Wi-Fi to find the details. The Wi-Fi was password protected however and the Ryanair staff member was not exactly showing any signs of wanting to help. I am of the opinion that it was extremely difficult if not impossible for a passenger to be able to retrieve the data. With time to board fast approaching we had no option but to pay 70 Euros each a Rip-Off total of 140 Euros to print two boarding passes. No wonder that several review sites describe Ryanair as ""The World's Most Hated Airline"".","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have the opposite to say. In both destinations in Athens and Stansted I found the staff very polite and very helpful. They were very organised and I was pleasantly surprised. The seats on the aeroplane were not too comfortable but for a short trip it didn't matter. The plus point was that travelling with a small child the arms of the seat lifted up and being flat it was easier for my daughter to sleep on the journey. The only down point that I could say is that the staff talking on the intercom I could not understand very well their English or Greek. This could have been a fault of the intercom. I found them excellent and compared to other airlines very competitive. It was the first time I had travelled with them and would do it again. I gave fair for value for money but that's because all flights from Greece to England are far too expensive. Please bring the price down or make more offers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I used to dread flying on Ryanair though in practice I had very little choice. The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days. May it long continue.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

However for convenience of a bargain flight and an airport about 12 miles from my doorstep STN I flew Ryanair. On this occasion I have flown this route with this operator before for pure convenience as opposed to the BA LHR to Larnaca flight I took in August offering all scheduled services meals beverages etc. Ryanair offer basically a seat and free use of the toilet everything else comes at a price and experienced over four hours of constant sales. The seating cramped. For a medium hall flight just over four hours I found the 737-800s seating too cramped.

However Malta was a different story on our return to Bristol on 9th November 2014. We had no bags to check in so went straight to the Departure section. Though I had pre-booked our seats and we should have had priority it was like a free for all the operative walked around the queue collecting boarding passes. I again needed special assistance and was subjected to a lecture from the Maltese operative because I had not checked in for this assistance. Nowhere on the boarding pass did it say I needed to check in just go to the departure gate. I informed the flight crew that I could not walk to the rear door (our seats were at the front) but no notice was taken of this and I had to wait until the cherry picker was brought to the front. A very officious young lady informed me I was delaying the plane as the next flight could not load. When we returned home I found an email dated the 4th November (we flew out on the 2nd November) informing me what I had to do to obtain special assistance.

The lady came around with drinks I ordered a coke which turned out to be the smallest can of pepsi in the world for 2.50 euros. No frills 100 per cent low cost not really. Would I fly Ryanair again?

FR 9697. October 31. Business Plus is a waste of money if there is a bus from the terminal to the plane since then one does not receive Priority Boarding. Also there is no Priority Deboarding so if one is in row 16/17 and there are exits front and rear then one is last off the plane and last at Passport Control. To be of value Business Plus passengers should always board first and deplane first. This would mean that the passengers would travel in a separate bus and all the Business Plus seats should be at the front of the plane just as in any other airline.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As a point to point airline Ryanair never puts any responsibilities for any delays causing missed connections. We had a sharp 2 hrs at Paris to catch the next flight while the first flight from Seville was delayed a slightly over an hour due to extreme weather. You cannot expect a better pilot on SVQ-BVA route who was very informative and explained to us the delay causing him to change the parking three times and eventually used the airbridge. Flight from BVA was delayed allowing us to have an extra time. Return journey was fine. All in all very satisfied with the flights. We enjoyed both food along the way.

Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Everything was what one might expect of a low cost carrier so no surprises there. However I missed my first flight due to 'visa check' procedures they require for those who are not EU/EEA citizens. Even though I did not require a visa for either of my destinations their insistence on this was not the real problem however but that they had so few agents working that this process took much longer than the security check on both legs of my journey. So it really spoiled my experience (especially in missing my first flight which then caused me to incur additional charges to get onto the next flight) simply because they did not have enough agents working. Additionally because they made such a fuss over 'checking visas' I would have assumed they would be able to provide UK arrival cards on-board since they would know non EU/EEA citizens need these as I've always done this with any other flight instead of having to fill one out after landing. They however did not have these on the return flight which meant I spent even more time at the UK immigration check simply because they did not have them.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

First time with Ryanair after spending the last 10 years avoiding it. No choice but to fly with them due to virtual door-to-door nature of route for quick Maltese holiday with a bit of business thrown in. Was expecting the worst but pleasantly surprised by on-time flights for both sectors decent if unspectacular seating and lack of the patrolling of queue by staff looking for oversized baggage - it appears that they've chilled out a little. So nothing to complain about as such other than £4 for a 330ml can of Heineken which I obviously passed on.

Really new to the concept of bringing your own boarding pass from home and being charged if you don't. I'm pretty sure there will come a time when these airlines would want you to bring your own seatbelts and oxygen masks. The ground staff very strict for checking your baggage weight. First at the check-in then again after the security check which was an inconvenience and didn't really make sense.

I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible.

I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Then had to wait nearly 30 mins as staff had not thought to arrange transport even the pilot was fed up with their lack of organisational skills.

We felt like cattle not customers. Stansted we were held up getting to airport we had priority booking but had to wait with everyone else as priority queue had gone therefore one of the cabin bags had to go in the hold. At Rhodes we were first to check-in and they took the first 90 cabin bags in the hold. Surely it should be the last? There seems no reason now to take cabin bags at all! The benefit apart from the cost is that you can exit the airport much quicker at your destination. Waiting for cabin bags takes as long as waiting for large luggage. The overhead luggage compartments were half empty. It just seems like another Ryanair useless rule.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Bought the ticket online 2 weeks ahead and it was cheaper that the taxi ride to the airport. Did not expect much but I was quite impressed with them. I work as Cabin Crew so I do know how to travel with a low cost carrier. I paid the extra 10eur for a seat on the first row. Extremely comfortable and thanks to the included priority boarding hassle free experience in the airport. My bag was a bit bigger (the side which was supposed to be just 20cm was slightly larger did not experience any problem). Staff extremely polite and professional both in the airport and in the air. Flight landed 5min early in BVA so absolutely nothing to complain about. I paid 23eur for a flight ticket and got early to my destination on board a brand new Boeing 737 aircraft (the aircraft had been delivered only a week before). I will definitely fly Ryanair again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

When we eventually took off at 10.30 pm we arrived at Malaga to find that our shuttle service had gone. This was now around 2.30 in the morning. Had to take a taxi at an extra cost to us of £100 - eventually arrived at our destination at 3.30 am - not good for two 73 year olds!

Was stranded for more than 15 minutes outside the aircraft on the tarmac before porter with wheelchair turned up. I shan't forget the blank expression on the faces of the aircrew staff either which made me feel very uncomfortable I'm sure it can be improved with more staff training and please slow down the food and drink trolleys as no one gets a chance to buy anything at this speed and it might cause an accident.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The service from both is good and Ryanair are normally the cheapest. I have had 3 delays due to weather and one diversion to East Midlands last year due to the weather. I do hear complaints every now and then on flights for both airlines the majority by people who are not seasoned travellers and only fly on limited occasions. The complaints were mostly why cant I sit at the front because they see these seats are free but they are told you cant have these seats as the aircraft needs to be balanced. Most accept this others don't and they hold the queue up by arguing. Then you get the guy and his mate who hover around the extra leg room seats to see if they can get one and they block the aisles and hold the queue up. Now that allocated seating is on all aircraft these problems seem to be resolved apart from the odd idiot who says I want to sit next to my mate but we did not get that option when we booked so can you sort it this again holds the queue up. With regards to the aircraft staff yes they have their bad days but that is not surprising as they see the same type of idiots flying in and flying out. The expression you pay peanuts you get monkeys however does not apply to the majority of staff I have come across and the vast majority of regular travellers appreciate the stewards and the service they give. If you wish for a better service then dig deep and save up for the next ten years and you can fly business class.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The staff at the back of the plane frequently came to the front as they were having some kind of disagreement and arguing over some gossip from another flight attendant that was not present during our flight. It was a he said she said thing that involved all of them. My partner and I were not able to get seats together when I booked for extra leg room for us both so we had aisle seats however the 2 seats in front of my partner were empty and it would have been nice for attendants to have offered us the seats so as we could sit together.

My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes. Ryanair finally seems to be aware of what attracts customers apart from low fares and is addressing some of the issues I hope it continues.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My family and I travelled to Benidorm for 7 days. Our travel with Ryanair was less than perfect. On the flight over I ordered a small bottle of Prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. She did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. I had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. Thankfully it was white wine. On our return flight I badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the co-pilot and finally I had to stand up. I was told from the toilet to sit down I was again told to sit as the co-pilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. I again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated I use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. (I was in row 9). As I approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat I had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on I tried to explain and eventually stressed I had to use the toilet “now”. Then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which I did. The was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board I do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes. I will avoid using this airline again if at all possible I am extremely disappointed.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

However upon arriving at East Midlands airport for our flight to Tenerife South recently with plenty of time to spare we found that there were 12 flights departing at roughly the same time. 12 flights of people that needed to check in and clear security before boarding. It seems that Ryanair just bung everyone together regardless of which flight you are on Some people were panicking as their flight was taking off soon and were stuck at check in when asked to jump the queue were told they would have to wait like everyone else! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and clear security. Queues were snaked round the airport (although admittedly this is not Ryanair's fault!) but a better system needs put in place for Ryanair check in. We managed to get to the boarding gates just in time albeit at the end of the queue. There we were kept waiting for 20 minutes as staff now needed hand luggage to put on the hold. The staff member was very aggressive and rude to us trying to grab our bags to put in the hold we told her that we needed the bags for inflight and one contained valuables that we wanted to keep with us. She tried to snatch my husbands backpack from his back and took my daughters small suitcase from her before I took it back. We eventually offered one bag but I had to remove everything that was needed and carry it in my hands she wouldn't even give us a carrier bag. She went up and down the last remaining passengers trying to grab peoples hand luggage but as nobody else would offer a bag she came back to us telling us she needed our bags we refused but She wasn't having any of it and barked at us we didn't have a choice as we were at the end of the queue and if we didn't put our hand luggage in the hold we would be fined £60. Her attitude was appalling and if she'd have asked politely we may have tried our best to accommodate her request. She wouldn't let the last people through the departure gate thus holding up the flight until she had the bags But no way were we giving up our remaining (small) bags. We eventually got on the bus to the plane and on the flight there we sat for another 20 minutes before actually taking off! It was never made clear that only the first 60 passengers were guaranteed to take their hand luggage. Yet on our return flight home everything was smooth queues moved quickly and staff were very pleasant helpful and polite. We packed our bags accordingly and offered our hand luggage for the hold. We fly Ryanair because it is cheap but cheap doesn't mean but I expect to be spoken to like dirt from someone's shoe!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

With all the bad press and negative reviews about Ryanair I vowed never to fly with them. However on balance it was better than expected. Friendly flight attendants and apologies about the slight delay on departure. There was enough leg room for my liking even being a male of average height and the aircraft was clean. The only thing I would do is remove the garish yellow. But that's a matter of taste. Ultimately exceeded my expectations so kudos to Ryanair. I think the key is to stick to the rules which have been relaxed slightly recently and you'll be just fine. Wouldn't really advise priority boarding as it was pointless with seating now being allocated.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

You get what you pay for. Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. Overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly Ryanair.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Had allocated seats so didn't see the point in queuing like a sheep. Joined the queue when there was 5 people left got my partners bag checked into the hold free of charge due to lack of cabin space. Took our seats and our nice smooth flight was over and done with in 2hours and 40minutes as scheduled. On board there was a few hiccups the cabin crew hadn't handed out the inflight magazine which includes the food menu and were only three aisles away from me I asked for a book and calmly stated ""you should have already handed these out!"". The stewardess immediately apologised and offered me an extra 10% off perfumes which I did not use. Also in the row behind us was three kids (in three seats with no adults) one young child proceeded to kick my partners chair rather violently whilst the parents were relaxing with headphones on unaware to their child's misbehaviour again a quick word to the stewardess and an adult was moved beside the children and the mischief stopped. My only concern is I am a tall man and with having not booked extra legroom I found the flight quite uncomfortable.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The new Ryanair is the same quality as easyjet or Norwegian. There are improvements which made the journey fine and we will fly the airline again. We got to new Stansted airport and the experience was OK. Boarding opened 1 hour before and began 40mins before. The plane departed on time and smoothly. There are no advertisements on the overhead bins and there where no scratch cards. An ok trolley came with food for sale. OK priced. Better than the airport. We landed 15mins early and no fanfare?

The return flight a few days after was quite badly delayed we were probably in the air about 30 minutes after we should have left Dublin. We did board and got underway after a while but there was the substantial delay (which went without explanation) and then they had the audacity to start flogging superfluous amounts of miscellaneous tat. After spending an hour in a queue in Dublin T1 I don't want perfume or scratch cards I want quiet! Ryanair are perfectly okay for those who want a cheap holiday but I would much rather pay the extra and fly with either BA or Aer Lingus from Heathrow.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Excellent flights both ways - an unexpected bonus was getting premium seats and priority boarding at no extra cost when we checked in online two days before flying. Cabin crew courteous and friendly and both flights although each about 10 mins late pushing back from stand landed on time. Use Ryanair about 12 times a year and have never had a bad flight except for one (MAN-FAO Feb 2014) which was delayed because of storms which affected all flights to Southern Europe that evening. Crew were trying to be helpful but abusive and drunken behaviour from a mixed group of twenty something's caused us to miss our revised take-off slot while the police removed them. As long as you read the website carefully and follow the booking and check-in instructions Take a bit of responsibility for your own arrangements then there shouldn't be a problem - although it never ceases to amaze me how many people forget to pack their brains when they travel.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We found the check in lady very pleasant and kind who made checking in our luggage very easy. The aircrew were helpful and cheerful and although we were late leaving by 30 minutes could not have served us any better. It was very busy at Mallorca airport on our departure and we had a bit of a wait in the queue but this was because most people had not checked the weight of their luggage so were re-packing.

Ryanair really can't help annoying customers can they? Now there are allocated seats priority boarding has no real value. So what do they tell you? - ""If you want to guarantee to have your hand luggage with you on the plane then you should pay for priority boarding"". So in effect you are being charged for having your bag with you. I am a regular traveller so don't take hold luggage to avoid the waiting at the destination. The small bag allocation is insufficient so I rely on the hand luggage. There is a hand luggage locker for every seat on the plane so how can they justify ""first 60 only""? Ryanair shareholder please note if there is an alternative to Ryanair then that's still the one I choose!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They are not BA but you need the mind set that it is like catching a train and do not expect luxury. But it means I visit my house in Portugal regularly and often pay more for the car parking than the flight.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

All flights were late leaving but made up time except for the Poitiers- Stansted leg which was delayed by 1 hour due to a passenger injury at boarding time. My only gripe is that I had booked a Shannon-Nantes flight and Hertz car hire in January. Ryanair cancelled the Nantes fight in May offering a flight to Poitiers or money back. Transfer went very smoothly. However Hertz told me that they did not have an office in Poitiers and my only option was to cancel which I did only to be charged a 50 euro cancellation fee even though I had booked through Ryanair. Small print and all that. Ryanair flights were excellent with very friendly and helpful staff.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As others have said as long as you follow their strict rules on baggage and boarding passes there should not be a problem.

Avoided Ryanair because of their aggressive policy but decided to give them a try again. Finally Ryanair has understood that free seating leading to a scrum has had its longest time. The allocated seating for decent fees is a big improvement. Onboard only harassed once for a lottery. No constant announcements for buying this and that anymore. Leg room stays a problem though as they press 198 passengers into a Boeing 737-800. Wouldn't bear a FR-flight longer than two hours. All in all a decent experience for less than 200 euro rtn for two including bag priority boarding - worked well but isn't really necessary anymore with allocated seating - and reserved seat. If you reserve a seat at the time of booking you can can check in 30 days prior to departure. Well worth the extra fee for people who complain they can't print their boarding passes while being away from home.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

There are no internet cafes in Sliema Malta so thought would print off boarding pass at machine at the airport. On arriving at Malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy Ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me I was too late and should have done this in Malta (How exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel?) before finally pointing me towards the computer where I could do this. This touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so I was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this woman's complete lack of customer service. An EUR 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. What gets me is that I knew I had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. I noticed Lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. I had to beg this woman to tell me where was the Ryan Air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me I was too late etc when I still had time. However reading other reviews it looks as if even if I had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged. I am sure they can afford to install these with all the EUR 70 fees they have been stashing away this summer.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As being called 40 mins before and getting to gate 35 mins before we thought the plane would be there in 10 mins. It wasn't and was there no earlier than 25 mins of waiting at the gate.

The flight was smooth and fine. I had a Pepsi and just looked out of the window no IFE or food. We sat in row 5 and had priority boarding. The aircraft landed 10 mins early and we had the usual fanfare. We where de boarded quickly and went straight through to meet relatives who have a 2nd home and took our bags with them. La Rochelle to Stansted. We got there 2 hours 15 mins before flight and we went through security. Relatives driving back took bags with them. There is 1 duty free shop and a cafe. There where 2 aircraft departing at same time and being the first in the lounge gets us a seat. (La Rochelle gets overcrowded). The aircraft got in 10 mins early but the other Brussels flight was late. Boarding began 10 mins before departure and we where off just after the Brussels 15 mins behind. The flight was ok.

This was a real surprise. I see that the staff have new marching orders and that intimidation is no longer the order of the day. This new more normal”attitude is already being noticed. Passengers are already taking liberties with hand luggage it will probably not be long before a new clampdown” will be enforced and unpleasant situations will once again be splattered all over the review sites. I made sure I had ticked all the boxes and weighed in before travelling this time. My previous experience has made me paranoid”about using this airline. I would have preferred not to have used Ryanair. They offered the best price for the trip and as money is tight I was compelled to take the risk. We can remain optimistic and hope they carry on in this manner. Perhaps in 3 to 5 years they will have a positive reputation. I still have reservations Ryanair inflicted such needless blow to my family that I am afraid to say it will never be forgiven. In the meantime I will reluctantly use the airline when needed and hope for more uneventful flights.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have always been able to take my hand luggage in the correct size bag on board without any problems. Today however I was waiting to board the flight at Skavsta Airport when then airport staff start walking along the line of people waiting and randomly telling passengers the flight was full and the had to put their hand luggage in the main hold. When I pointed out that I had some breakable goods in my bag I was told that if I was that worried I should had been in the queue earlier. As it happened There were about 10 people in the non-priority queue ahead of me. Also my travel companion was at the end of the queue but was allowed to take his bag same size as mine on board without problems. There was no logic at all. TO me it seems like the only way to guarantee that you can bring your hand luggage on board is to pay the ""priority boarding"" fee. Not sure if this happens on other Ryanair routes but the same thing happened to my daughters also at Skavsta a couple of weeks ago. Is this another sneaky way to make money?","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I was well aware of all the pitfalls and extra charges and then made the mistake of mis-spelling my own first name. I thought 'here we go' especially as I couldn't get through on the phone even the £1.09 a minute line. Then I stumbled upon their 'live chat' facility got connected within 2 minutes and had the name corrected. They emailed me a revised confirmation. Of the flights - well the pre-allocated seats are a great improvement - saves that awful scramble on board with the FAs screaming 'if you don't sit down we'll lose our flight slot' and passengers coming to blows. The boarding pass saying front or rear of the plane is sensible. Unlike previous flights (which was what finally put me off Ryanair) there were no cases either at BRS or GRO of passengers being harassed having their luggage weighed or measured or any sign of people being charged for things. Most notably I didn't hear any passengers grumbling about anything. So the simple impression of just 2 flights is that you get what you pay for on-time clean planes and a vast improvement from 4 (plus) years ago. Whether I want to brave a STN flight is debatable but I need to fly home later in the year and I won't be too worried.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Had a horrible start to my journey thanks to the Stansted Express service on which I was stuck for 2 hours due to technical difficulties. Missed my flight as a result and Ryanair transferred me free of charge to the next flight which was the following morning. Very much appreciated considering it was not their fault I missed the flight. I needed to make it back to Shannon for a trans-atlantic flight the following afternoon so they saved my holiday from being cancelled. This along with the various upgrades to their service in the past 12 months (additional carry on bag reserved seating etc) have made Ryanair my choice of airline when flying from London. Customer service is dramatically improving in my opinion and as long as you know how they operate and how the pricing structure works then there shouldn't be any issues when flying with them. I'm not sure how so many people are allowed to leave bad reviews on here when the source of their problem is very often the customer being at fault and not adhering to the ""rules of low-cost flying""!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We accidentally had two pieces of luggage too much (this was our own fault) so we paid the extra other airlines do the same so its not just Ryanair. Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them? Do they do it on purpose maybe hoping they get the full service and not paying for it? I like Ryanair they bring you very safely from A to B for very little money. I don't expect much from them but I am always surprised they give good service for the money you pay.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA. Although BA are pretty woeful 3.5 hours on a Ryanair flight is far too much.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least.

When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The first trip (Stansted to Pisa) was delayed 45 minutes. Its not so much the delay that's the problem it is the total lack of communication or an apology for the late running. We were asked to queue up for boarding and stood there for over an hour with no communication. Worse was to follow. On the following Saturday we were booked on the 22.00 flight out of Pisa for Stansted. Again no communication or apologies were forthcoming from Ryanair. 150 minutes after the flight should have left we were told it was cancelled - no apology again. We were not offered any refreshment during this three hours. They then booked the passengers a hotel but had only a mini bus to start with to take 16 passengers a time randomly selected by Ryanair staff. We eventually arrived at the hotel at 03.00 but had to be up for an 07.00 departure from the hotel. No food or drinks were offered by Ryanair. No staff were available at Pisa airport to speak to or to hand out vouchers. The service was shabby at best. No apologies poor communication no-one to talk too and no refreshment vouchers either. We will not be travelling with Ryanair again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Flew Malaga to Ibiza return fantastic staff marked off first 90 customers who could take on board cabin luggage no standing in a queue you just walk up to the priority line when suits. On our return just sat there until the last few loaded in row 8 plenty of overhead cabin space as again only first 90 allowed on board. Whilst both flights full the final 90 or so passengers loaded fast as they had no luggage. There was a few complaints by those not allowed cabin luggage especially when we walked up at the last minute with our hand luggage. All in all from booking to in flight very good shame you don't have the seat space on our normal Jet2 flights.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This books them a place in the queue without themselves queuing it happens in both the priority and other queue. I thought that bags were not to be left unattended anyone could leave a bag and wander off - needs to be stopped before everyone decides to put a bag down in the bag queue and then take a seat.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The first time was a return trip from London Stansted to Santander in May 2014 (FR2612 / FR2613). Despite worries about Ryanair's reputation it was a very positive experience. The flights including 15 kg of baggage and all extras were very reasonably priced. Both outward and return flights landed a few minutes. Return leg saw us being placed in emergency exit seats rather than our allocated seats which meant extra legroom. Cabin was clean. Seats don't recline but were fine. By following all Ryanair's instructions (printing boarding passes etc.) no extra money had to be paid. Would happily use them again in the future.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known! Eventually arrived back in Bristol over four hours late. Needless to say will not be rushing to use Ryanair again anytime soon!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Placed a booking Ryanair changed the rules between the time I placed my booking and date of flying which meant they expect me to receive return flight boarding cards by email whilst on holiday and then try to get the hotel to print them out for me. There are too many ifs buts and maybes in that scenario so alternatively - pay 13 per person to be able to print boarding cards before we leave the UK.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We checked and confirmed the flight status on the Ryanair website the night before the flight. We got an email from Ryanair a few hours before departure saying the flight had been cancelled without stating any reason whatsoever. We tried calling the Ryanair hotline to no avail. We checked the Ryanair website and called Bergamo airport to check if there were other Ryanair flights to Budapest as we had a pre-paid rooms that night in a Budapest hotel and definitely had to be there the next morning a the very latest. There were no flights on the same day or the following day from any Milan airport. We had to commute to Milan Malpensa to buy expensive alternate flights to Budapest with an overnight connection at Warsaw. Ryanair is an absolute nightmare of an airline. An utter waste of time and money and the absolute pits in customer service. We will never book it again. Our travel insurance will not fully cover all the expenses we were constrained to incur because of this cancelled flight. Please spare yourselves the aggravation.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Overall not too bad I guess for a budget airline but the new introduction of the 7 day boarding pass malarkey meant we were stung on the return flight for 70 euros. As this is on the return flight we had obviously spent up and had to contact one of the groups husbands to ask if we cold charge to his credit card to get us home. At no point was this new procedure explained to us (and yes I appreciate it is probably in the very small print but if you are a regular flyer with Ryanair (which the girl who booked was) you would expect something like this to at least be mentioned when you book) and I can in no way begin to fathom how they can justify 70 euros. It is simple case of robbery and Ryanair should be ashamed of themselves. We were by no means the only people caught out with this phenomenal fee and it certainly feels like you are being held to ransom. Another peev was that when we boarded some people had to put their hand luggage in the checked in luggage area as we were told there was no room in the above holders - lie! They were nearly empty. Because of the unjustifiable boarding pass scam I will certainly never book a Ryanair flight of my own accord and I will be telling anyone who chooses to to think before flying Ryanair.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

In my experience when I was leaving from Birmingham for Barcelona I was requested to put my cabin luggage into the sizer without reminding. Since my luggage which its design is flexible and there are two rows of zippers at that moment it was not suitable for the sizer. I said I can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didn't have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. Their attitudes were like robbers and I didn't have any options then because there was nobody beside me. Actually when I returned from Barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but I've used a belt to tie it up. Therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. Due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when I left form Barcelona for Birmingham I've also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. I understand terms and conditions of Ryanair in advance. But what a shame the attitude of Ryanair’staff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. How come they charged it without any warning (If I could have one more minute to organise my suitcase.) before boarding especially originally I've been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate. I won't recommend anyone to be Ryanair customer and would tell them the story to warn them if they still have to.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

So this now means that I will have to find an internet cafeé whilst on holiday or pay 70 euros for each boarding pass. What a scam. Just cannot understand Ryanair on this one.

People moaning about not being able to print boarding passes or check in for more than a week in advance should book reserved seating on the aircraft this allows you to check in and print boarding passes for the following 30 days! Ryanair makes it's profits from various add ons - i.e baggage seat allocation expensive food/drinks. Once all this is added the difference in cost with booking with another airline is still substantial. I am flying to Gran Canaria next week for which I have paid £106.48 return including the added seat allocation reservation. I checked in for both flights on the 17th April. I shall be taking a sandwich onto the flight which will saved me paying £6 for a tasteless one from Ryanair I'll even take a soft drink on board. When booking my flight I had the option to fly Thomas Cook Norwegian Air or Jet2 on the days I wanted to travel - however all 3 were over £300! I could of flown BA via Madrid for££233 alternatively but that would of meant changing aircraft and flying the second part of my journey using Iberia from Madrid hence taking nearly 7 hours.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I tried calling before the flight but their customer support number could not be accessed outside of the UK and Ireland.

Firstly that they would stop being secretive about their latest scam and secondly if they continue to fly to Valencia they consider not changing flight details with such short notice. In March I booked some flights home from Alicante having read in their terms and conditions that they were changing the 14 day check in online to 30 days from April. However nowhere did it mention that they would be charging for the privilege or I most definitely would have booked easyjet who have had the free 30 day check in for sometime. In relation to Valencia flights they have two scheduled flights a week. In the past after disagreement with Valencia they just cancelled the whole route so I was pleased it recommenced even if it was from Manchester. They have now had to push the Monday flight back by half an hour and have given me 3 weeks notice of the change. It now lands at 11pm. Now that doesn't seem like a lot but unfortunately it has quite an impact cost wise as the majority of the car hire firms in Valencia close at 11 and therefore charge you 30-40 euros to open later. Sadly I'll have to now give up on Ryanair just when I think they were really trying hard. I have always followed the rules and never been disappointed with them to be honest you get what you pay for but I'm finally getting to old to try and stay ahead of their next money making change and 7 days check in is ridiculous so it's back to Easyjet.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Returned 11th April FR3153. It's great to see that they are finally trying to improve customer service and it was definitely better on the way out. Having allocated seating now is much better although it was not clear when I booked that seats are allocated free at online check in so I unnecessarily paid £40 to do this in advance. Also what on earth is going on with the 'only the first 90 bags' can stay in the cabin idea? Great that you can now take a small bag (handbag laptop bag etc) and put it under your seat. However only the first 90 passengers are allowed to take a correctly sized and weighted wheeled case on board. At Tenerife they decided that everyone had to do this before they got on the plane and it was chaos with people trying to work out what they needed to take out. Strange also that they only pick on wheeled cases even small ones. My partner had a rucksack the contents of which were about the same weight as mine yet my bag was tagged for the hold. By the time I'd taken out all the valuables - camera iPad Kindle etc there was very little left in it. Also there was plenty of empty space on the overhead compartments once we got onboard. All completely pointless. I do think they are trying but they really don't think these things all the way through! All that is going to happen is that people's 2nd bags are gradually going to get larger and larger and there will be the same old rows at check in and the gate as there have always been! Other than that it's pretty good value for money I guess although I agree with other comments about flights times. Lots of them get into Stansted too late for the last trains which prevents me booking with them. Oh and the seats not reclining and no pocket for belongings continues to be tedious. Especially on longer flights. Still punctuality is very good and it is cheap I guess!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

If you compare the flights with travel by coach (which is how they are priced) they are easily as good. One has to stick to the rules and those who try it on with the cabin luggage size and weight allowances deserve all they get in my view. I do feel sorry for those who innocently don't pay enough attention to the very thorough pre flight reminders you always get sent. My flights are about 2.5 hours and that's fine but the seats are a tight fit and do not recline (I am not large but fellow passengers often are) so would not want to be onboard much longer than that. Aircraft's are in good nick and always clean and staff are generally friendly and helpful. Food is edible but only in an emergency! Coffee is fine and sensibly not served too hot. The lottery ticket sales used to grate but as they do fund deserving children's charities it is harsh to moan about that. Reliability on the route I use is excellent as is baggage handling. It is what it is - don't try to judge it by comparison with anything else.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We accept that this was our fault but I like to think this was human error. Again we accept that staff cannot be expected to spend hours printing off tickets for idiots! However do you really need to charge so much to do so?

Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate. Crew on board were professional and what I've noticed is that they smile and are happy to have friendly banter with passengers now - so that's a really added plus since my last trip! Seats not amazingly comfy but ok for the short flight. Arrived in Porto ahead of arrival time and bags were on the belt almost immediately (this is something good that hasn't changed!).

Derry to Birmingham and back. Having read the reviews it was with some trepidation I booked the flights as they are the only airline flying to Derry it was forced on me. The web site wasn't too difficult and I was prompted by online live chat if I dallied they were helpful and reassured me only one booking had been made. Paid for hold luggage as I had a laptop bag as well. Reserved seats were welcome. I printed the boarding passes off before hand and arrived in plenty of time. Onboard reasonable bit garish and the selling wasn't too obnoxious given only a 50 min flight. Depart and arrive on time. So overall the experience wasn't too bad but then everything worked ok. The nagging feeling is what if it hadn't? But given the price you get what you pay for. Would I fly with them again? Given it was the only airline to that airport then yes. If to another airport and there was an alternative and there were consequences to not arriving on time and the company was paying then I would think very hard about it.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Don't expect much on the service side : they have very good deals for the tickets and they bring you from point A to B that's it! Be careful though with all the added fees they can charge.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Cons are the seats are not comfy at all the staff are arrogant the leg room is very limited the food is expensive and when you board the aircraft it has a very weird strong smell.

I experienced appalling customer service on a flight from Bristol to Dublin on 14th Feb. A male steward took Ryanair's poor customer service to a new low - he was extremely rude bad humoured and swore in front of my 11 year old daughter. Additionally Ryanair's new seat allocation policy appears to be at the expense of carrying on your hand luggage if your bag is not in the first 90 bags on board. Not only had I the inconvenience of lugging my case around the airport but had to wait for it in Bristol as it was taken off me as I boarded. Always 1 step forward and 2 back with Ryanair Easyjet is cheap and cheerful Ryanair is cheap and nasty.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They get you from A to B on time and cheaply. You can still check in up to 15 days before the flight without having to pay for an allocated seat despite what they say. In fact if you are crafty you can actually choose your seat free of charge by doing the following: click on 'Choose a Seat' check which ones have already been allocated knowing that they allocate the seats in alternate rows front and back starting either side of the overwing exit rows. If you are happy with the next available seat then exit this page and click on 'Do not Choose Seat' and you will get that seat. If you are not happy with the location of the next available seat then exit check-in process altogether and try again later. It works!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This is the most budget airline I have come across I became paranoid about the weight of my luggage! Thankfully we were within the guidelines however on arrival to the gate (2 Ryanair) employees were waiting to pounce scrutinising everyone's hand luggage and asking them to place their cabin bags in the frame. Lucky for us we were OK but numerous passengers who 'could not fit' theirs were made to pay £50 which were then put in the hold. Why did the check in staff not ask to weigh their cabin bags at check in - in my opinion this is the way they make an extra £50 per passenger - some cheap flight for these unfortunate people (students) many of whom were going home for half term and short of money to begin with - for me never again.

Because of my flight times this means I will have to find a place to print out my boarding pass while away.

First of all a flight 2 weeks in advance from the booking date for £9.99 one way can not be denied this is a brilliant price for an on-time flight on a virtually brand new 737-800. The one gripe I'd have is the allocated seating (something that most airlines use effectively). As a frequent FR traveller I pick the same seat every time unfortunately the common sense of booking and then finding your seat seems to have evaded some people as it turned into some chaos - so I'd advise to still get on the aircraft towards the front. Other than that I'm extremely happy to fly Ryanair again and again as the on-time no-frills cheap flights will always be too good to turn down! Follow the rules and you will certainly enjoy your flight.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Stansted to Tampere out 31st Jan return 3rd Feb. The allocated seating (on the return leg) was a big improvement. The seats are still bolt upright but at 6ft 3 I've never found the legroom to be that bad. This leaves us with the migrane inducing yellow the bright cabin lights and the constant procession of scratchcard sales and frankly annoying announcements about the still overpriced microwave food to moan about. They seem to have at least stopped the irritating soft drink adverts on replay. I guess Ryanair are an option if they are flying where you want to actually go but my own conclusion - as a relatively frequent flyer - is that there is no point in saving a little bit of money if it costs you a lot of time and hassle which on this trip it still did.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As the trip date approached I received an email from them stating that the return flight time had been brought forward by 7 hours with no reason or explanation and a short one line of apology buried in the small print. As this was a 3 ½ day trip I elected to cancel and have a refund as I felt that it was unacceptable without explanation to curtail a short break like this. I re-booked with BA from Gatwick at an additional cost of £60 for two.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

First and last time I'll use this airline - total rip off. Stood for an hour at Edinburgh check in then another 45 minutes at the gate in the hope my wife and I would get a seat together (why should we pay extra for this?). On board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. All cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. We heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old Ryanair trick. Return check in at Tenerife was ridiculous 5 Ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks that's nearly 700 passengers. No Ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. Usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege? Its standard with everyone else. More rude cabin staff on the way home which cemented not only ours but a lot more people on boards perception of Ryanair - never again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I fly quite a few times a year but this was my first time with Ryanair so I was interested to compare. I have to say if you follow the rules that are made very clear to you well before departure you will have no problems. There were a few people who hadn't printed boarding passes or their cases were far too big for the cabin and they were moaning about being charged to check them in etc. Yes the fees for printing are totally ridiculous for printing a sheet of paper but just don't get yourself in that situation! I had booked an exit row seat for an extra £10 which included priority boarding. I have to say it was worth it especially being tall. I arrived at the gate 45 minutes before the departure time to see a huge queue waiting for the boarding to start. The priority boarding queue was empty so I walked straight down and waited for around 15 minutes. Then a member of staff came over and said would you like to come forward we are ready after my pass was checked the barrier for the others was opened. I boarded the plane first after a few minutes wait at the bottom of the stairs of the plane and got settled whilst everyone else boarded. I'm not sure if this system works if there is a bus to catch to the plane? One benefit of being nearer to the front of the queue is getting seats with family/friends and having space to store luggage as many people we struggling to find places for their luggage once the plane was filling up. The flight was comfortable and crew were fairly friendly but seemed in a rush to serve drinks and were quite sharp with a few customers who were asking for a drink of water. The people in front were drinking their own alcohol and were sharply told that they couldn't consume their own alcohol on board. Overall I found the experience far better than expected even though the service of other airlines isn't present but the price was far far lower! I would fly Ryanair again especially as their flights seem to have few delays and they are bringing in allocated seating.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

You get what you have paid for: Affordable and safe transport from A to B. Pros: Price modern planes efficient and friendly cabin crew. On time arrivals. Cons: If you have additional luggage you have to pay for it. Make sure your carry on meets the exact size requirements. Seats are a bit tight but for the price I paid I can live with it Comments: If you are budget conscious and adventure oriented definitely go with Ryanair.

The 3.20pm flight eventually left at 10.20pm - 5 euro refreshment voucher. We queued for the flight at 7.05pm but that was cancelled for technical reasons. Passengers were offered transfers to flights to Manchester or Birmingham or the 10.20pm flight. I suppose not their fault but instead of asking passengers who wanted to go to Manchester to go to one desk and the others at another desk I was told ""first come first served"". Strange thing was the late flight could cater for all the passengers who were going to Liverpool so the technical fault saved them a flight to Liverpool. The 10.20pm flight was a nightmare with about twenty males all drunk and swearing and having to be advised by cabin staff to behave to be fair there was no alcohol sold on the flight. I will continue to use Ryanair as they are cheap but when possible travel on early morning flights you miss the stag/hen/football fans. I am looking forward to the allocation of seats so no more stampedes for the departure gates and they are only doing what Easyjet and Aer Lingus currently do. On this trip can only score 4 but have had plenty of tens over the years.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As ever Ryanair was punctual and efficient. It is a flying bus from A to B. There is no ceremony involved. Ryanair has a couple of simple rules about baggage and to have your boarding pass before you arrive. If you can't arrange something as simple as printing out a piece of paper and complain that you have to pay for luggage on top of your massively cheap air ticket to begin with then just don't fly with these people. I'm off to Morocco next from Stansted for less than £70 return.

Mercifully he fell asleep but did not fasten his seat belt during landing although he then stood up while the plane was still moving quite fast. There was no inspection of seat belts by cabin staff before landing nor was he told to sit down. Our seats were near the emergency door where passengers are supposed to assist with evacuation. He was a big man who was in no state to assist and would have been a serious hindrance if there had been an emergency. Clearly the policy of the cabin staff is to sell as much booze as possible and not bother with basic safety or the comfort of other passengers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My complaint is about the airport departure experience. Being a party of 5 with a baby we paid for priority boarding. What this meant in practice was that we had the pleasure (!) of standing at the head of a queue for about 75 minutes. The flight was about 30 mins late arriving and departing which must have been known by the departure gate staff yet they made no attempt deal with the queue that formed either by telling people to go and sit down while waiting or delaying checking people through the gate. I have written to Ryanair but am awaiting a response as I write. I can't rubbish them completely as the flight was relatively comfortable and onboard staff were quite pleasant. I understand Ryanair is to introduce a policy of seat allocation this should stop a lot of the problem we experienced though not the part where airport gate staff let passengers through the gate over half an hour before departure.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It was my first time flying with Ryanair and I really wasn't looking forward to the flight as I have heard many extremely bad reviews. The flight in all honestly was not a bad flight we arrived 15 minutes early into Manchester and I have no complaints regarding the crew on board they were pleasant and polite. This company have a terrible reputation for trying to get money any which way they can however if you read the terms and conditions properly there should be no reason for you to part with your hard earned cash. The seat pitch was fine for me a female at 5ft 4 inches and for the 45 minute duration but I can imagine it must be extremely uncomfortable for men as I can imagine if you tall it would be awful for those longer flights. One thing which I really didn't like was the non-existent seat allocation. I felt as if I was part of a cattle herd trying to get on board as people had started to queue an hour before we were due to depart to ensure families got seats together. Ryanair overall is not terrible you get what you pay for. They are a budget no frills airline and I think people tend to forget about that. There is no inflight entertainment not even an inflight magazine people who expect these things really need to remember how much they paid for the flight. I will fly again if they are the cheapest option.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The flight times were perfect too. So we booked with them due to recommendations cost and convenience. The charges are clearly outlined on the conformation e-mail that you must print the passes before you reach the airport! In my opinion people that turn up at the airport without their printed pass are asking for the extra charge. If you don't have a printer then pay for check-in at the airport! Everybody knows Ryanair is about cheap basic travel and if you're expecting anything different then you are ridiculous.

First time using Ryanair booked via an online holiday site and wasn't aware on booking that it was Ryanair. We had printed off our boarding passes and booked in hold luggage with smaller bags for hand luggage which fitted under our seats as due to the ridiculous size of hand luggage now allowed by most airlines have had problems in the past finding space above so I don't think it is worth the hassle this is by no means exclusive to Ryanair. Flight was good on time purchased only coffee at 3 euro don't think that is extortionate to pay. My complaints would be: 1) never having flew Ryanair I wasn't aware that it was unallocated seating and this caused a stampede for the seats. 2) due to the quick turnaround the plane was not cleaned between flights and the floor at my seat was covered in used tissue. From Dublin priority boarding did get on first but coming back in Ibiza everyone put onto a bus at the same time priority boarding let off a few minutes earlier but hadn't completed boarding when the next lot got off so I don't think I would pay for PB if flying with them in the future. Yes would use again but not if on a longer flight as wouldn't want to be separated from my travelling companion on a longer journey.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

So hold luggage booked priority boarding additional infant equipment all paid for. Flying from Edinburgh to Faro was okay long queues at check-in but okay. Trek at Faro up and down stairs 2 year old and 3 bags not great but can't blame Ryanair (although can't help but think they are treated as 3rd class because of the deals they make with airports). Chaos on way back one person at check-in no priority queue at boarding pass check. Advised it would be at the gate nope people were allowed to stampede if you were already at the back tough! So on return to UK I complained and requested that the priority boarding fee was refunded. Rather than customer service I received a curt ""we do not make refunds"". So despite not getting what we paid for they pocket the money anyway Will we use them again probably simply they put they get you there but I will treat them with the same respect that they show their customers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The plane seemed fine pilot information was good regarding weather etc. I have to say we did follow the rules I purchased scales to weigh our bags printed the boarding cards at the correct size and arrived in plenty of time to catch the plane. I was ready for a very unpleasant delay with grumpy staff in poor uniforms and dirty seats to sit on but what I got was actually a very good service from what appeared to be a reasonable airline operator. Would I have wanted to fly to St. Lucia on board maybe not as the finer comforts are not there but for me I would definitely fly with them again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Liverpool to Reus. Always the cheapest. With Ryanair all you have to do is follow some very basic rules and you wont have any trouble at all. Make sure you have booked in any hold luggage on line its much cheaper but you can take 10kg each as hand luggage6 of us so spreading it round saves you a lot of money. Also it amazes me when people cry when they have to pay the £60 if they haven't printed their boarding cards before hand. Why not? I do not have a printer so just pop down to a local library to print them out. Yes Ryanair is a bit like catching a bus and you just sit where there is space but so what flight times are not long haul and I'm sure you can put up with it for a few hours. There is a lot of selling during the flight but again so what. Don't buy anything if you don't want to. Food is a rip off agreed so I have never purchased anything. So let me give you an example of how much cheaper it is to fly with Ryanair. It cost us a family of 6 just under £ £600 in Sept for return flights to Reus.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Perhaps I am too fussy as I normally fly scheduled for business and this was the first time I used Ryanair. I weighed my case at 14kg but Ryanair insisted it was 17kg. I was told to take things out and put them in my golf bag. If you forget the boarding pass that is printed by yourself there is a penalty of££70! The crew on both legs were surly. All they did on a 2.5 hour flight was to try and sell things. Boarding is a joke with everyone squeezing 10kg in lockers which do not have the capacity. As I said I normally fly schedule and they appear a similar price for far superior service. Although the flights were on time passenger service and treatment with a constant aim of collecting more money is a dreadful experience.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The total inflexibility on luggage weight is a sham and price gouge policy. We are both smallish people our carry on luggage was well under weight and one checked in bag (which of course we paid for) was 1 kg over bang another 20E ie it is per bag if hers was under and mine over you still pay on the one that is over. The flight crew were fine but the check in woman forgot to stamp my wife's boarding document so having gone through the queue we had to run back for that. The airport shuttle service from Porte Maillot to Beauvais was very good but it is 1.5 hrs. Ryanair is now my airline of last resort.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We sat awaiting to board when the call came up. We watched the farce play out as passenger after passenger wrestled with their carry on to shove it into the small regulation box. If they couldn't get it in the little metal box they got fined. As the line finally whittled down we decided to board. They don't turn on the air-conditioning until the plane is in the air. It was then we realised that the seats were not allocated first come first serve. We had to hold our carry on on our laps. I looked above me wondering why we couldn't put our carry on in the overhead compartments. Finally the aircon came on - just about the same time the captain started advertising the sale of scratchcards.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Being a first-time flyer I certainly don't have the experience to compare it with other airlines but I must say I don't get what all the fuss is about. Everyone seems to hate Ryanair and I had a very pleasant experience with them. No troubles with luggage we weren't even asked to measure it or weight it at boarding though I understand that was a stroke of luck. Staff were very polite and nice the only rudeness I witnessed were from the passengers themselves mainly some who had the luck of boarding with clearly oversized bags and then were surprised when they didn't fit in the compartments. Seats were comfortable they are no tighter that the average bus/train seat I was expecting much worse from all the reviews I read. Flights arrived earlier than the quoted time. They do play a lot of ads during the flight for their services but you aren't forced to buy anything and the staff doesn't get all in your face with it. All in all a very pleasant flight. I could have never afforded the trip if it wasn't for Ryanair. Just don't go to one of their flights with your mind set on trying to beat their system. If you want it cheap then you must abide by their rules. If you don't want to be bothered with that just go with the pricier airlines.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The airline offered me the choice of pre-booking a seat as there weren't many left to choose from going by the list of available seat's. Once we got on board only 4 rows were reserved and were told just find a seat after row 5 they are all free. As for coming back from Spain this week all of the Spanish people were pulled out of the long queue and moved to the front. Is it just English people who hate queuing. My girlfriend purchased a wooden gift which weighed no more than 2 pounds and 4 inches wide but it was 5 inches taller than the allowed case height. She had no hand luggage so thought it would be reasonable to take it on board. No it was classed as oversized and the woman in charge having no common sense wanted to charge us the sum of 60 Euro to stick a label on it. Once on board we found several seats still empty. Surely knowing this a bit of lenience would have been used. Where once on board the seat next to us was empty anyway so she had to leave it at the boarding gate. How about teaching common sense in your training.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

On the way back on Sep 16 2013 the flight was delayed and we finally boarded at 11.00 pm and of course by then I had learned my lesson and ran to the plane to get a space in the overhead locker. The female flight attendant was obviously very tired and huffed and puffed all the way to Paphos If was very visible that she hated her job and all the pax on board. The male flight attendant drank from a water bottle closed the toilet door with his foot and counted the money at the end of the service in the front where all passengers could see.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I fly between England and Germany. This year I have travelled with them 4 times. After arriving at Bremen airport today my partner and I entered the queue to hand over her luggage. We had paid an additional 30 EUR the night before in order for her to take one piece of 15kg luggage as it is not included in the Ryanair booking price. My partner was flying to Stansted which is about 40 Miles north of London. After 5 minutes of standing in the queue the Ryanair person working at the desk disappeared and was talking to her friend at the hand luggage and boarding card control desk. I went over and asked her why she was not manning the desk any more and she said ""because I only take luggage 40 minutes before take-off"". When I said ""but we were waiting there and you closed the desk without even telling us"" she then lost her patience and got really rude. Subsequently we paid the 60 euros. They call themselves a ""no-frills airline"" but in effect they are indeed an uncaring ""no-service airline"". I would give them one star out of 10 for their airport staff. I will not be flying with them again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We were very surprised at how smoothly everything went. Coming back from Palma it was obvious the people in front of us had used Ryanair before. They were a couple with two children and had put a large bag on the floor with coats on top and got the youngest child to lay on it. The father had another large bag over his shoulder. The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase. After we all boarded a young couple squashed into the extra legroom pretending to let people pass by then were amazed that there was no seats left together so they ended up sitting there. We the ignorant passengers had to pay for our extra leg room.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Paid for extra leg room which came with priority boarding. Well worth the £15 each way to not stand in the queue to board or worry about not being sat together. The seats are very narrow and each seat is separated by an immovable board so you can not straddle empty seats. Can not understand the reviews of people complaining about getting charged for not having their boarding pass. Ryanair email a week before to tell you that you must check in online. No excuse in the world will get you out of this but you are told by email. They also email you the day before the flight with the hand baggage measurements so no excuses there either. Where they do let themselves down is when the flights are delayed they offered no information whatsoever and there was a four hour wait of everyone staring at the screens. Planes are also often dirty due to them not being cleaned in the short turn around time. As long as you're flying to a proper airport and not a satellite (and end up paying for train/taxi/bus to get 60 miles+ to where you wanted to go!) one then they tend to be the cheapest by a long way as long as you play by the rules. For a 2 hour flight I can get over the lack of service and the slightly uncomfortable seating. Even booking extra leg room they were still 150 quid cheaper than anybody else for return flights.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Coming back was like a cattle market! All crammed into a waiting area so hot people pushing and queue jumping priority went through and some passengers that were not priority pushed their way in and were not stopped what is the point of paying when you can just push in? The aircraft was filthy and I had to sit with my feet in biscuit crumbs crisps bread crusts empty drink bottles - it was disgusting. Even when the seatbelt light was on people kept getting up and fiddling with their luggage. Also when the cabin bags were checked many of them pushed and shoved their bags in the testing rack - so much so that one man pulled his handle off and threw it across the airport floor! This testing of cabin bags does not work as several should have been in the hold but these people wanted to get away with paying and were arguing with the airport staff who jut let them through therefore Ryanair is losing out on payments for luggage and honest passengers are paying the price it needs to be sorted!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This is a budget airline and all extras are stated on booking on their website. For all those who wish to pay over the odds eg. extra £700 per family to fly to a destination then book Thomson or Thomas Cook however we used these one way to Reus and had an hour and half delay compared to every flight with Ryanair on time or usually 10 mins early. Some people just like to complain if you have a young family and want to sit together pre book seats or alternatively use Priority Boarding. I only wish Ryanair flew from Cardiff airport as we would save even more travel costs however it is worth the trip to Bristol as you could never fly a family of 4 from Cardiff for £700 to Canaries. Look forward to booking our next trip!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children 10 and 14). We knew that seats weren't allocated but as long as one of our kids was sat with us each we didn't mind. Check in was quick and easy at Bristol as was boarding. Boarding Passes - it clearly states that you have to print them off prior to travelling and you have 14 days to print off your returns if you read the terms and conditions this is quite clear. Yes food and drink is a little expensive but I have never know an airline yet who sell cheap food and drink if you don't like it then buy it in departures prior to boarding. We experience some bad turbulence when landing which meant we had to take off again and land in the North of the Island. After sitting on the tarmac for 30 minutes we were told that buses were waiting for us at the front of the terminal to take us down to Tenerife South other than a little bit of confusion with the staff at the airport this went quite smoothly. People were moaning and complaining about Ryanair and standing in the aisle of the plane when we had all been asked to remain seated until further instructions were given but all I can say is I was happy to land safely rather than Ryanair attempting to land in such bad conditions and put everyone at risk! Staff were friendly enough the return flight was good and they got us back slightly earlier than planned. The plane did not seem anymore uncomfortable than others we have travelled on and it was clean. Lastly if you have young children I recommend you pay for priority boarding or make every effort to get to the front of the queue before boarding if you all want to sit together.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

In the bigger airports their slots are obviously the cheapest and therefore the most inconvenient for passengers. The flights are cramped and the boarding process is very slow. Staff are often pleasant. The flights are not necessarily the cheapest; in domestic Spanish flights for instance by the time you have added a reserved seat and luggage in the hold you can travel cheaper and more comfortably with Iberia or Air Europa. Flights from Spain however to Baden Airpark or Ancona for instance are convenient because they are not routed through hubs with long conveyor belt waiting-times and one can often find an airport close to one's destination.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

For the return my wife had to leave a few days early due to unforeseen circumstances so she departed on a different flight from Seville. At Malaga airport tried to check in with the 2 kids and 2 bags - only to be told had to pay an extra 100 Euros on the spot to 'transfer' one of the bags from my wife to one of the children. Otherwise would not be able to take it. Means I paid approx £130 for the one suitcase plus £50 for the other. Absolute rip off; and the flights were not exactly cheap even before the add-ons.

What I have noticed the same problems occur time and time again. People don't read the rules you don't get something for nothing you know that with Ryanair - accept it. Why do people with children think they have the right to complain when they saunter on to the plane at the last minute and wonder why the are unable to sit together. People get to the check and have to start unpacking cases because they cant be bothered to weigh there luggage. Ryanair is the cheapest not the best I accept that but most of the problems I have seen are caused by the passengers themselves.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My family who live in Rimini have just informed me that Ryanair is stopping flying there from September so I phoned customer service to find out. I was told yes it was true and asked if I wanted a refund. Is that all you've got to say I inquired. After a long silence I was asked again if I wanted a refund; there was no explanation. To summarize Ryanair know that they are not going to fly into Rimini at Christmas but have no intention on informing the poor passengers who are looking forward to being there for Christmas. Not only they are holding on to everyone's money. They will hold you to ransom nearer the time leaving you no choice but to fly to Bologna or Ancona at inflated prices.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The next flight from Limoges to Stansted with availability was 3 days later. So we accepted a flight to Leeds the following day. That was all that was done for us we had to arrange our own overnight accommodation transport to and from the airport etc. My advice is if you travel with Ryanair: Make sure you have access to the internet because you need to react pretty quickly when the flight is cancelled as the airports are usually in the middle of nowhere. Know the location of the other airports Ryanair operate. We were offered a flight from Bergerac the next day but the airport staff could not tell us how to get there by train. Don't book stuff for the day after your arrival. There were people in the queue with connecting flights tickets for the Olympics that they could not use. Based on the above I would not travel again with Ryanair if I was travelling to a tight schedule. In total we got home 26 hrs after we planned.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It was now the time for the safety announcements prior to take off I do understand that this is important however I have never seen such miserable faces from the cabin staff. We were sitting in row five and it took nearly 1hr to get served I think mainly because they had to keep explaining what they had run out of even before we took off. The list was endless of what they hadn't got. When it was our turn I ordered 1 bottle of water a whisky and a can of coke I was taken back a little when they said that's 11 Euros. I quickly put my money back in my pocket. All they wanted to do was to sell scratch cards and smokeless cigarettes. Overall not impressed at all and will never travel Ryanair in the future.

I am incredibly disappointed and disheartened by my most recent experience with Southwest Airlines. Let me preface this by saying that I have been flying Southwest for years, am an active rewards member, and currently have three upcoming trips already booked (booked before this experience). I flew out of Orlando, FL on Thursday night 5/24 at 9:15 on flight 1388 with my husband and 9 pound dog. We have flown multiple times with our dog in the past. I have always given our dog Melatonin to help her sleep while we fly (to avoid her ears popping/hurting). She was given Melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. We sat in our chosen aisle, me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and I juggled two drinks. A flight attendant decided to approach us and say ""What's in the bag?"" to which my husband answered, ""a dog."" Terry then said, ""Okay, it needs to go under the seat."" No problem, we know that already so we said, ""Okay, we're just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under."" He then came back I kid you not within one minute to proceed saying, ""The dog needs to go under the seat."" At this point we were getting a little upset. Once again my husband said, ""We know."" He then stayed right behind our seat while I gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. I looked at my husband and mumbled, ""Gosh, can we put our seatbelts on?"" At that time, the FA very abrasively turned around, stepped into our aisle, and proceeded to yell at me saying, ""Yeah you can put your seatbelt on!"" I looked at him like a deer in headlights and said, ""Okay, I think you need to take it down."" He then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying, ""Take what donw, tell me what I need to take down?"" By this point my husband and I were visibly upset. I again said, ""Take it down."" but again he continued to yell at me and say, ""I did nothing wrong!"" My husband said, ""Actually, you're yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong."" He was the most ill behaved employee I have ever encountered in customer service. Not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. There were people recording this. Finally he stormed off. I began crying. The entire ordeal was disrespectful, disgusting, and completely unacceptable. I pay $95 dollars each way (just like every other person who flies with their pup) so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. In addition, we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience. I called Southwest to make a complaint and was able to speak to a very nice woman who unfortunately informed me that not much would be done. This complaint would get added to his file and the incident would be used as a ""coaching"" lesson. Basically, this individual's egregious conduct was endorsed by lack of follow through. I am beyond let down. I am in no way looking for this man to be terminated at all, but he does 100% owe both me and my husband a formal apology for his flagrant behavior and nothing is being done to rectify the situation appropriately.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

It was left to me to find a way to San Francisco for me and my family and, at my expense. The third flight (from San Francisco), was diverted to Pueblo Colorado to gas up when it encountered bad weather over Denver. This resulted in us missing our 5:30 p.m. connection to Raleigh Durham. We were rebooked onto a flight departing Denver at 11:00 a.m. the next morning. Southwest offered No accomodations to my son and me. Food, hotel accomodations, and transportation to and from the hotel was left for me to figure out and to exspense. Southwest has mastered the art of telling customers that they are sorry and there is nothing they can do; and, that they do not accommodate customers for bad weather because they cannot control the weather. Furthermore, trying to get any help from customer relations and airport supervisors has proven to be useless. Finally, there should always be someone higher up to call, even on holidays and weekends. Passengers should never be stranded at an airport and met with no solution or assistance from airline staff. Very unhappy customer.

At the day of our flight, at least 50% of Southwest flights was delayed, one, two, three hours, pretty common thing apparently. The plane is a standard B737 with nothing special to tell about. The service consists of a free non-alcoholic beverage (rather small portion with a lot of ice) and a mini bag of pretzels or peanuts. The staff was OK. Plus, their open seating policy (seat wherever you want) is really a terrible thing to offer if you are not a solo traveler. The reason is because the frequent flyers always benefit from priority boarding (and a lot of SW passengers do) and you are entitled to be in the second half of the boarded passengers. If you are not a solo passenger, you would probably end up split to multiple rows, because all the already boarded passengers with frequent flyer accounts are usually travelling alone and all of them like to seat on A, C, D and F seats, meaning when you enter the plane and you see almost empty seats B and E, but almost all A,C,D,F full, it's really pitiful view - again, this applies if you are a couple, family or a group of friends.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

My brand new bag was ruined. I literally opened the box brand new the morning before my flight. It was a birthday gift, and after my flight that evening it looked like it had been dragged behind a luggage truck for a mile across the pavement. Since my flight arrived at 1am I was tired and figured no customer service would be open and would deal with it in the morning. Upon calling I was told by the women on the phone that you must bring the bag to the bag to be inspected within 4 hours of your flight to receive any sort of compensation for the damaged bag. I asked to talk with her manager. She told me she was the manager and would not let me speak with anyone else. This policy is ridiculous especially for flights arriving in the middle of the night, and I am incredibly dissatisfied with the customer service I received with this airline. Will not be flying with them again. I’ve attached photos of My two brand new bags next to each other (the smaller one I used as the carry-on) Rips that are all over the bag and wheels that are about ready to fall off at this point","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/0B0FB6CE-B6C5-4602-811F-BC2FBC7221AC-e1527176402409-50x50.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/C621EFE7-12D9-4956-99D4-466BA6D922CC-50x50.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1C43A59D-940B-47E6-96CA-B5A165FE999B-50x50.jpeg","; ; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/0B0FB6CE-B6C5-4602-811F-BC2FBC7221AC-e1527176402409-500x500.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/C621EFE7-12D9-4956-99D4-466BA6D922CC-500x500.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1C43A59D-940B-47E6-96CA-B5A165FE999B-500x500.jpeg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/0B0FB6CE-B6C5-4602-811F-BC2FBC7221AC-e1527176402409-500x500.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/C621EFE7-12D9-4956-99D4-466BA6D922CC-500x500.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1C43A59D-940B-47E6-96CA-B5A165FE999B-500x500.jpeg","; ; ","Type Of Traveller

We were due to land at 6:55 pm and board a connecting flight at 10:05 to Detroit. At 7:08 pm, I got a text from SW that we were being re-booked to leave Monday at 4:00 pm. The plane I was on had to go to Orlando to refuel, and then back to Atlanta. We were on the plane from 2:30pm to 10:30pm, with no additional food, water, or drinks offered. Once in Atlanta, the customer service rep; re-iterated what I already knew, that we could not leave until Monday and gave us a voucher for a discount rate for a hotel. We booked the hotel (Holiday Express) in College Park, Ga, They don't take vouchers from Southwest only Delta and told us to go back to SW for a discount re-imbursement. I just finished talking to a customer rep in TX, who advises me that he could not help me with that issue and tells me how the airline is not responsible for Acts of God - I knew that, but my issue is with the hotel and the voucher. No further offerings of any kind or telephone numbers that I could take this issue further.","Not Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

When the flight out of Austin kept being delayed and reached 4.5 hours late because of weather in the area, we would miss the connection in Atlanta. They lady at the counter told us that meant they would cancel our fair and find an option to get us out the next day. We didn’t like that option, so we found a flight that got us to the Jax the same night through Dallas. That flight was also delayed because they were unable to track down the crew, and once boarded, we sat in line to take off. We finally took off only to be told they were not doing full service because of turbulence. All of that was unfortunate, but I understand Southwest hasn’t figured out how to control weather. When we landed in Dallas, we were told the original plan for those flying through to Jax on the same aircraft has changed and to deplane and check the monitors for our new gate. No Jacksonville flight existed out of Dallas. The flight to Jax we were supposed to be on had left hours ago! They purposefully left us behind. I quote Sean at the counter: “they ditched you to get the other people in the air.” I find this absolutely unacceptable. We should have never been allowed to come to Dallas after our flight had taken off. S The poor customer service continued has they refused to provide accommodations for us in Dallas because they blamed everything that happened on weather which they aren’t responsible for. When we pressed that sending us to Dallas was a mistake, the supervisor said it wasn’t; it was their bad weather plan. I explained again what happened in Austin - It was our plan to fly through Dallas but we were supposed to stay on our plane. And they said that they left hours ago because of weather so the mistake was because of weather. The bad day continued when we found out our bags had made it to Jax and were not in Dallas with us. So we had to find our own accommodations last night and will be rewearing our outfits as we hopefully get home on a flight to Jax today. If everything today goes according to plan, we will be landing 22 hours after we originally were. I am very disappointed with Southwest after yesterday.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Upon checking in, I received a text from them saying that our flight is having a 2 hour delay. Staff told me she doesn’t know about anything. I explained my situation to her saying I had an appointment to be there by 11:15am with the delayed flight I will not be able to make it and the appointment is what I am flying to SF for. She responded rudely and saying they had no other flights and I said how about other airlines if they could connect me to - they just didn’t help at all. I was panicking during the whole flight and hope that I would be ok. I got there late as expected but luckily I got what I need to get done. In the middle of it, they texted me saying my return flight will be 1 hour delay and then half hour later they texted me and said my flight got cancelled after all. I called and asked to put on later flights. They girl on the phone said we had no flight that day, but we have tomorrow. I told her I have no where to stay and asked if they are going to compensate my hotel room. She was like no but I could put you on a flight tomorrow! I said could you also check Oakland, she did and said we could connect you to the flight from Oakland to Arizona and Arizona to OC. I told her no, I wanted a direct flight and that’s what I paid for. She found one and that’s cool with me at least I have more time to explore the city. After checking in, they texted again and saying our flight will be an hour delay. Our flight was originally taking off at 8:25 and now 9:25. I asked the counter if they know they can’t land in OC after 11pm. The girl gave me bad attitude and said it’s the weather, we can promise you anything - and shortly after a customer service manager made an announcement saying they need to fix the plane in order to board u, they will leave us 10 mins to be boarded. If we can’t make it, the flight will be cancelled. Everything was great and started following direction and we closed the door at 9:30, took off about 9:42 and we landed just in time. I don’t know how they had no motivation for situation like this - if they delay or cancel people’s flights that they paid for, shouldn’t they give them free food vouchers or hotel rooms?","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I showed her that we had “A” passes for that same flight. She said that since I rescheduled those were gone, but she could Sell us some “A” passes? Really? I never meant to reschedule anything.

Finally, because I complained, they removed me from the TSA pre check for my returning flight. If it was a weather issue, why didn't they just keep our plane on the ground, and let us all take off on hour or so later? When the flight was cancelled in the morning, I had asked to be put on another airline since they couldn't get me on anything earlier on Southwest, and they said that that wasn't required when it was a weather issue. I think it was a profit issue for the airline, not a weather issue. They gave me vouchers, but I don't want to fly Southwest ever again. I wanted to be at a special dinner with my son and daughter-in-law which I missed thanks to Southwest.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I found that, for the savvy flyer, Southwest really isn't any worse than economy on a legacy carrier, especially with their new basic economy classes. Just be sure to check-in quickly and arrive promptly for boarding and you're guaranteed an aisle or window seat. There was only one hiccup on my flight, during boarding. The sole gate agent was responsible for getting 2 wheelchair-bound passengers onto the plane, which took a significant amount of time. Overall, though, I would absolutely consider Southwest when it makes sense financially.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

We had a very troubling experience with my 6-year-old son flying as an unaccompanied minor on Southwest. He was bumped (although he had a confirmed seat) in favor of standby passengers. Southwest says it was because he didn't have a boarding pass, which apparently can happen even if you check in at the ticketing counter with an actual person who has you sign all the Unaccompanied Minor paperwork and gives both you and your child documentation to go through the security checkpoint. It wasn't a boarding pass! When I called Southwest to get my son onto a different flight, they put him as ""standby"" on a flight going out on Monday morning -- two days later -- and waived the $260 ""change fee."" I called back, asking if he could fly out from a different airport the next day (instead of two days) and they said he could, but I'd have to pay the ""change fee."" They said nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" would be in the customer relations office until Monday morning (the day my son was scheduled to fly as a standby passenger.) Ultimately, I went on Facebook and made a public post. This got results. Southwest changed my son's ticket to a different city so he could depart the next day, with a confirmed seat, and without a ""change fee."" (Kind of proves that there was somebody in the office who had the authority to waive the ""change fee"" at the time they told me I'd have to wait until Monday to talk to someone with that authority.) Then, Southwest didn't answer a bunch of specific questions like, ""What time was my son's confirmed ticket released so that a standby passenger could board?"" and, ""What protocol did the gate agent follow to contact my son's guardians when the gate agent realized that an unaccompanied minor who had checked in at the ticketing desk had not yet picked up his boarding pass?"" In Facebook message, Southwest representatives sent me copies of their ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page of guidelines from their website. They were trying to prove that my son had forfeited his confirmed seat by failing to arrive on time. In fact, the ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page links to another Southwest website page called ""suggested airport arrival times"" which says only that passengers should arrive at the Ft. Lauderdale 60 minutes early for domestic flights. When I pointed out that my son had met these requirements (although NOT the more stringent time requirements being described after the fact by the customer service representative) the Southwest representative wrote, ""I certainly regret if the information your family relied on was not the information provided on the specific Unaccompanied Minor page."" No, ma'am, it was linked on the Unaccompanied Minor page, and there was no other information on the Unaccompanied Minor page. Basically, Southwest representatives bumped my son out of his confirmed seat. Then, they lied to me by saying nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" was available to help me reschedule his flight until Monday. Then, they blamed my family for not following arrival guidelines that were not actually published, and told me that the guidelines we followed (from their public website!) were the wrong ones. Ultimately, the customer service representative told me she had no further information for me, and that she had assigned me a ""file reference number"" to use if I needed to contact their Executive Office. It felt like a brush-off, rather than a real effort to help.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.44.40-PM-50x50.png; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.47.01-PM-1-50x50.png; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.47.01-PM-50x50.png","; ; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.44.40-PM-500x500.png; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.47.01-PM-1-500x500.png; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.47.01-PM-500x500.png","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.44.40-PM-500x500.png; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.47.01-PM-1-500x500.png; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-07-at-8.47.01-PM-500x500.png","; ; ","Type Of Traveller

Nonetheless, we missed our connection flight by 20 minutes thanks to the Captain who didn't attempt to contact Austin about the delay. So, we approached the agent at Austin who contacted the Supervisor who was also helpless and she informed us that we could either rent a room, wait at the airport til the next morning and leave on flight 655 on Wed the 21st at 7:10am boarding time. So, we went back to the agent and managed to obtain boarding group ""C"" tickets with ""EXTRA TIME"" highlighted which means we board after group ""A"" & before group ""B"". We had boarding group ""A"" throughout our entire trip and this was of course our first ever time traveling Southwest Airlines and should I mention any else. We were stranded at Austin Airport for more than 10 hours and also a young lady with her 3 year old daughter who had to be in Reno and also missed her 1st connection in Austin. What puzzles me and leaves me flabbergasted is how Southwest Airlines who doesn't care about leaving passengers stranded, couldn't care less if you ever travel with them, are not transparent and have poor customer service.

However, the doors to the plane were still open, and after repeated requests from most of the passengers, the staff would tell us nothing of why exactly we were stalled so badly that a lot of us feared something was fishy, sketchy etc. Babies were screaming because they hadn't eaten in hours but mom's were not allowed to go and get them food even though we sat there for a very long time. They wouldn't allow passengers to get up and use the restroom until we pretty much said we were going to just go everywhere. The staff was extremely rude and didn't communicate to anyone why we were being delayed again, which is their job. I overheard multiple families saying aloud ""this is why you don't fly Southwest"". Nor I or any member of my family will fly Southwest again!","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

On the day we flew into the city, our flight was delayed over 4 hours and then completely cancelled at the last minute. We had to rebook with American Airlines on the spot as Southwest had absolutely nothing that would help us. They provided us with a $200 flight voucher, but that was nothing compared to the $800 tickets we had to purchase on the spot at the airport to be able to arrive in NYC in time. Today we are flying back, and our flight has just been delayed 2 hours, therefore causing us to miss our connection flight. When I called customer service, the woman on the phone was rude, inconsiderate, sarcastic, and very unhelpful. After 20 minutes on the phone, she provided us with a few other options, but all of them would be much at our expense - which was completely unprofessional due to the fact that the airline was the one causing the problems. We were left with no choice other than to stick with our flight and figure out what we are going to do at the airport. Hopefully we will not be stranded in our connection city. Do not fly Southwest.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I am extremely upset on the level of customer service, communication, and lack of empathy provided by Southwest. It’s disappointing to speak to a multi million dollar company who has the ability to make changes over $99 who opts not to. I purchased a ticket in June to travel from FLL to PLS (Turks and Caicos) on November 9th. After Hurricane Irma and the destruction of rental property, I was encouraged to contact Southwest in September and explain my situation. The representative reassured me that I would be able to have a travel credit due to the weather and cancellation of my trip. She explained to me that I have one year to use my voucher. Here today, I am trying to use my travel credit by Southwest to go to my graduation, and to me disappointed I cannot use my credit for travel for me and dad. After communicating with Southwest it was explained to me that ""Unused travel funds may only be applied toward the purchase of future travel for the individual named on the ticket."" This however was not explained to me when my trip was cancelled or I would have choose the option to receive a refund. I have explained my case to two representatives with Southwest. The last person I spoke with stated that I has three options (1)lose my travel credit (2) take off $100 off my credit, which the reminding balance then could be used on both travelers or the best one yet (3) Have my commander write a letter stating that I will unable to use the flight credit because I may be called to drill?","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They will give away your seat if you were not at the gate 20 minutes prior to flying. I know the general rule is to be at the airport two hours early, sometimes this is not possible with connecting flights. Southwest gave away my seat on the flight that I paid for, they told me I can get on the flight three hours later and wait at the airport. I was at the gate 18 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time, they told me it was too late they had already given away my seat. I fly Southwest twice a month for work.

Maintenance took care of the problem and we were on our way. Delay caused us to miss our connection to Philly by 5 minutes. So a great counter agent in STL, got us on a plane to Chicago after a 3 hr wait so we could get on a plane to Philly. So, on to Chicago. Arrived in Chicago and onto the plane after 2 more hrs wait. Onboard plane, waited nearly another hour for a customer running late for a connecting flight. Kinda like my flight from KC was late. After almost an hour, customer never showed. So thankfully, Southwest Airlines decided it was time to get their plane in the air. We arrived 13.5 hours later and 8 hrs late. So you would think nothing could go wrong on the scheduled return of Philly to STL to KC. Supposed to leave at 1.30 pm now leaving at 5pm. And to thank us for flying, they have given us an extra flight. Since we will now miss the flight to KC, Southwest has given us an all expenses paid flight to Chicago to catch a flight to KC. This will put us in KC at 12.20 am. 7 hrs late. I think I will rent a car in STL and drive 4 hours to home. $120 broker but in bed 3 hours sooner and 2 less flights.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Anyway, the cabin staff are great and always in a fun and good mood with the passengers. All Southwest planes are the same regardless of route so carrying on is no hassle.

Especially the last one going from Vegas to Kansas City Airport. Anyone can look up this information but just in case you’re wondering, tonight’s flight is WN5915, 03/17/18. Also when the plane did arrive, it arrived at the wrong gate which led to further delays and if you were using your Southwest app as your boarding pass, you probably lost your boarding pass since the app thought the flight had already departed (you can’t make this stuff up), meaning you would need a paper boarding pass and leave your A spot! Addendum: they had a bad exit sign which meant clearing the passengers out and doing paperwork to fix it, which has led to another 20 min more delay.

This is my third flight in 3 months on Southwest and each time, the flight is on time during boarding and then they wait 45 min to an hour for people on connecting flights causing everyone else to be late on their arrivals. People with connecting flights miss them because someone else who is late gets to hold others up. I can see 5-10 min, but not an hour. Southwest has never held a flight for me when my flights come in late due to weather. Why are some passengers more important? I needed to get home on time tonight and that didn’t happen.

The airline itself is not too bad. However, don't waste your money on early bird boarding. I purchased it from STL to DAL and ended up with B25 which you can get without paying extra. B25 is not early boarding, A1 through 60 will board first then 24 more people. So, by their definition being the 85th person to board is early bird. I called customer service and they explained to me that they just keep selling the early bird boarding no matter what it gets up to. No guarantee you will get in the A group. I feel like this is a dishonest business practice and somewhat deceptive. People assume if they're paying extra they will actually be getting on the plane sooner than most. Bottom line, do not pay for early boarding as it's pretty much a scam to make more money.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Southwest is great at its best, middling at its worst. There are quite a few places where Southwest blows all of its American competition out of the water. No change fees, no cancellation fees, and no baggage fees. This is not found anywhere else in the US. The fares themselves are typically cheaper than other airlines, especially if booked at least one month early. Otherwise, fares are average. Customer service is quite good and the free drinks and snacks are satisfactory in today’s age. And finally, the seats on all of their planes have good legroom. One of the few negatives seems to be their increasing rate of cancellations in the past year. I’ve experienced three cancelled flights since last August, which is concerning. However, that’s not always within the airline’s control. Overall, Southwest is most likely the best airline in the US.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I paid the additional fee for early check in both ways, and having booked my trip 3 months in advance, I was pleased with my position on the way and expected the same going home. Unfortunately, when it was time to check in for my flight home, I found my position was completely unsatisfactory, B22. I called Southwest to see if there was an error and was told that sometimes it just falls out that way. My issue is that if Southwest is going to take my money for early check in, there should be a guarantee for zone A boarding, OR give me an alert so I know what I’m paying for if I choose to continue. Surely if their system can assign boarding positions as flights are booked, it can alert customers when zone A is full, right? Sad to say I may be heading back to Delta after this.

This was the first time for me, luckily, to fly on one of the planes with the ""upgraded"" seats. Never again. In fact, I may never fly SWA again unless I absolutely have to. These new ""seats"" have pencil-thin ""arm rests"", without padding, meant to discourgage people from using them - and that design works: if you don't mind elbowing your neighbor, you'll get bruised from the ""arm rest"". The shoulder / arm area is thinner than normal, and unlike the older seat design, even very thin people, such as myself and the passenger on my one side, will be bashing elbows and rubbing legs when constantly shifting positions to try and get away from the constant pain of the seats. See, the seats have no padding. NONE. They seem to be made out of cardboard. There is not just no lumbar support or seat padding: it's shaped oddly the opposite that seating for humans dictates: the lumbar region of the seat goes back rather than forward toward your back, and the seat curves up at the part right under your upper-upper thigh (the seats are also the shortest depth of all seats). While you are hunching your shoulders forward to avoid being shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to bring your elbows in front of your chest and hold them there, while your lumbar region is being pushed into an outward curve by the back of the torture seat and your legs have circulation being cut off by the upward curve of the seat edge. After 30 years of flying only SWA for all domestic flights - 8+ in the past 8 months - I will not be flying with them again unless absolutely necessary. This flight was yesterday, and I am experiencing moderate neck, back, and leg pain as a direct result of SWA's torture seating.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The date is January 8 2018. The flight departed at 11.10 am. The only female attendant on the plane is very rude. My 11 month old son was overheating and needed a diaper change. I was at the back of the plane and had to navigate my way to the front of the plane, where for some reason the only changing table is located. The bathroom was occupied. So I was perfectly OK with waiting the few seconds it would take for the bathroom to open up. The woman turned, saw me and without even asking if I needed anything or was OK, snapped, ""you know you can't wait here. You've got to go back to your seat."" I told her we had just gotten up there and that this bathroom was the only one with a changing table. She didn't care so I had to go all the way to the back of the plane and change my son on the pull down tray, which is disgusting for me and the other passengers. As if that wasn't humiliating enough, the woman proceeds to get on the intercom as I'm walking back to my seat to announce (apparently for the millionth time. Her attitude knows no bounds) that no one is allowed to wait at the bathrooms. I have flown Southwest many times, and enjoyed it. Lines have formed many times and it wasn't an issue. But this woman's behavior is unacceptable. My son was overheating and needed a change, yet I basically was not allowed to use the only lavatory on the plane that had a changing table. I have flown many other airlines and none of them were as good as Southwest, but due to this experience, I don't think I will ever fly again. I'd rather drive than put up with this kind of treatment.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

On this same flight, there was an emergency in the aft cabin section that required attention of all attendants. Attendants kept everyone calm and were most professional in the manner she explained the emergency. As luck would have it, on the return segment from Baltimore to Ft. Lauderdale on December 31 the same attendant was again the cabin attendant on this flight. As departure time approached, the captain informed there was a maintenance issue with the aircraft. The attendant set an orderly pace for passengers to disembark, relocate to another gate, and re-board. I have flown SWA several times monthly for many years (including the time when segment credits were awarded instead of distance/cost points) and believe Southwest earns its wings, each and every flight.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Absolutely awful experience on Southwest. Flew 12/23 and massive snowstorm hits Denver. Roads getting to airport blocked, hundreds of people unable to reach airport late at night so I called Southwest enroute to state I would not be able to make flight and to rebook for next day. No one picked up on hold for 20 minutes so purchased a separate one way ticket for next morning so I could spend Christmas with family. Sent an email requesting them not to cancel return ticket since I would definitely still use it. On arrival the next morning was told my return ticket was cancelled since I was a “no show” for my original flight. Argued and pleaded with agents on phone and at airport to reinstate reservation and told basically “no way” and it was my fault for not cancelling the outbound flight. Explained again that I tried to call and sent an email and was told to “not be argumentative” but the very rude representative on phone.

I fly this route about 3 or so times a year and have always had good service from Southwest. Reno airport is a breeze to go through. The ground staff is friendly with smiles even at 5 a.m., security is quick and then you are at the gate. Had a 6 a.m. departure time which we pushed back from the gate right at, a quick de-icing and off we were. Cabin crew cheerful, the captain gave us updates during the short hour flight. Watched a beautiful sunrise and then we were in Vegas. Only minus was how hard the pilot landed the plane in Vegas. That for sure woke everyone up. Coming home our plane was delayed 20 minutes, then 40 minutes and then finally an hour. We were updated plenty of times with apologies and the reason for the delay. It was all good and we pushed back an hour late but within 5 minutes we were up in the air. Was very windy weather so the takeoff had plenty of ups and downs with bumps and thumps but again the captain kept us informed and said once we get up in altitude all would smooth out. And it did. A quick beverage service, some peanuts and an hour later we were back in Reno. Southwest always delivers a good product and is our airline of choice when flying in the West. Also enjoyed the free wifi using the Southwest app. Not a ton of choices but good enough.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Very disappointed in Southwest Airlines. I fly at round trip at least once a month with Southwest and I am usually very happy with the airline overall. However, I recently had a trip scheduled to go from Phoenix to LA, LA to Denver and Denver back to Phoenix. My client in Denver had to reschedule our meeting and my admin bought a new one way ticket for me to get back to LA from Phoenix and she also bought a new round trip to go to Denver the following week. Unfortunately, she forgot to cancel one of my initial flights (Denver back to Phoenix) and it was not until I received an email notification from Southwest that I realized the flight had never been cancelled. I immediately called Southwest (was on hold for 27 minutes) and explained the situation. I was hopeful that due to my loyalty and this one time oversight, Southwest would at least issue me a credit toward another future flight. That was not the case. It was explained to me that there was nothing they could do. I think it is time for me to find a new airline. One that will be at least a ""little"" flexible with me when a simple mistake is made.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The next time I fly with them they broke my new suitcase that had been checked. Now this time they cancelled my flight and didn’t tell me until I was at the gate. Leaving me with a 3 hour lay over and I should have been in California by 10:30 and I’ve been stuck in Vegas until 11 not getting to my destination for hours after I had planned. I understand weather can be an issue. But there is no excuse when the weather is clear and people are depending on being on time. I am cancelling my Southwest visa and will never fly Southwest again.

The first leg of our flight for unknown reasons (first they said unknown, then weather, then air traffic control issues). The flight was delayed 2 hours. We were notified 3 hours prior to original departure and immediately contacted customer service because we would miss our connecting flight home. We were told that There were no available flights to get us home from either our departure city, our connection city, or a near by airport we offered to drive to. We actually had a service agent say, ""It's not my problem. What do you want me to do? I can't invent a flight for you."" The next flight they could get us home on was in 2 days!! We were stranded. We had to get home for my husband's cancer treatment. After hours of frustrating conversations with ""customer service"", We purchased a hotel room for the evening and flights out for our family of 3 on another carrier. Have had 4 conversations with customer service vice agents via phone, a very insulting email from the airline and a frustrating Twitter exchange. The message is consistent. They refuse to reimburse, they are not responsible for missed connections due to delays, and they refuse to transfer to supervisors or give information to contact anyone higher than the call center.

The system of no reserved seats appears daunting but somehow it works really well. Once on the plane the cleanliness was surprisingly good, the legroom was amazing as I am 6'5 and my wife 6' and the friendliness of the staff was as good as we have ever seen.

On a way home our flight was #1612 and I agree with customers who had not pleasant experience with flight attentents. We had a few coupons for free drinks and decided to use it on a way home because it was my husband birthday. I ordered Bloody Mary. My drink was amazing. I received a can of mix, packet of species and a bottle of vodka. I had over ice and had to add it to my plastic cup again to finish all liquid. My husband called a few times our flight attended to order more drinks for him. Then we heard unnecessary comment "" don't you think it's too much of jack Daniels?"" Maybe it was a joke but we paid for our drinks and it doesn't say how many drinks you can have. We are over 50 years old and I don't think those comments were appropriate. Our""neighbor heard about celebrating birthday and decided to join us with her friend. She also ordered Bloody Mary. For our surprise light attendant brought her plastic cup with ice and already premixed drink. We were schocked. This lady saw me having like total of 2 cups versus one that she got. What happened to other part of vodka and mix of Bloody Mary? Are you guys trying to get $5/drink and split it for 2 people? Not cool at all. Very cheap move. I like Southwest, never had problems but this incident ruined my opinion about that. Unfortunately it's only airline we have to use to get to Cancun and its very fast.

When it came time to board the gate agent allowed everyone to board in whatever order they wanted regardless of their boarding number. I had A-1 but because the gate agent said people could board in whatever order people pushed past me to board first. I asked the gate agent what was going on and why we're not boarding in order. He said to just get on the plane. Once on the plane I asked the lead flight attendant what was going on and she said the flight was light so just take a seat. I contacted Southwest's customer service web page and filled out a complaint. I got a response from a ""no-reply"" email saying sorry but that they would do anything including not refunding the cost for the business select boarding they didn't deliver. My opinion of Southwest Airlines is they're unethical to charge you for something and not deliver, and then not even care.

I set up a vacation for my wife to go see her best friend in Arizona, this is her first time flying. Her flight was scheduled to leave from Midway airport In Chicago at 11:15am. We got there a couple hours early, got through checkout and thought we were good to go! 40 minutes before she's supposed to board, the flight got delayed and was now scheduled to leave at 1:35pm. We left to get some food and was back at the gate by 12:45. They then delay the flight to 2:35. Then just minutes later they cancel the flight! Went to the counter to ask what to do. They told us as long as the ticket had today's date we can go to terminal B17 and catch that flight. So we go to B17 and they informed us that was wrong and that they were ""probably just trying to get us through the line"". We then had to go stand in a different line, which we waited in that line for an hour and a half and in that time only went half way. I finally go up to the terminal attendant to ask him what we can do. He again said we need to wait in that line in hopes of being put on standby. Luckily a pilot overheard him and asked me what was going on. So I explained the story and he kindly went behind the desk and told them to change her over to that flight! I thought we were home free, but I was mistaken. He told her that instead of being a direct flight like the original flight I booked her, there would be a layover in Oakland. He said she wouldn't have to leave the plane when they go there. She called me in Oakland saying they forced her off the plane and since the pilot had the ticket she didn't have a ticket to show the attendant who was rude. So she got off the plane and tried explaining to the attendant what happened. The attendant told her ""to bad cause you don't have a ticket"". My wife went up to the counter panicking. The woman made a few calls and almost an hour later was able to get her on the flight to Phoenix. In Phoenix she was supposed to be picking up a rental car from Advantage (I purchased everything through southwest.com) and when I called to verify the car they said there wasn't a reservation. When I called to ask Southwest, they said they don't rent through Advantage. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they confirmed they do in fact rent through Advantage. Something apparently happened in processing the rental car so now her friend has to drive to Phoenix to pick her up. This was the absolute worst experience with Southwest.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

But the tower was fixed late night on 9/9/2017. As we talk to others that were forced to stay at the resort ($450 a night) with us their airlines Delta, American, United, etc. were understanding and scheduled extra flights to help out and get them home to their families. But Southwests' answer to us is to bad we aren't sending extra flights forcing us to spend an extra $2000+ on a room and missing out on being paid at work. Southwests' answer is you're staying until Wednesday 9/13/2017. I guess I had the wrong assumption of this airline and stand corrected.

Our frustrating and unexpectantly expensive situation with Southwest Airlines began on Sunday August 6th 2017 after having spent a wonderful weekend in Georgia at Ft. Benning to celebrate our son’s graduation from Boot Camp. Our group consisted of our son’s 3 parents and 1 elderly grandmother who needs physical assistance getting around. Ready to head to the Atlanta airport to catch our flight (2419) back to Dallas Love Field, we received an elctronic message stating that our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Dallas. We called home (Dallas) to check with our house sitter and other friends to hear what the weather was like. They said there were no storms at all. It was clear skies and very hot. I checked my weather app and saw no storms in the DFW area. We called Southwest customer service who said we could spend the night in a hotel in Atlanta and catch a flight to Dallas the next morning. But we needed to get back to work the next morning (a Monday). We asked for reimbursement for the 4 tickets we will need to by from other airlines. SWA Rep said we would need to call Customer Relations. But a refund is not possible since the cancellation was due to weather! When we arrived at the Atlanta airport we ran to the American Airlines ticket window and bought the last 2 AA tickets flying to DFW that evening for $536.40! AA ticket counter rep told us all flights to Dallas and DFW airports were flying with no weather issues. So we let our son’s mother and elderly grandmother have these 2 tickets since we were not sure there would be any other available flights out that night. Then we ran to the other end of the terminal to the Delta ticket counter. We bought 2 tickets to DFW for $654.32! Delta also confirmed no weather issues flying into the DFW area. The total for 4 tickets including terminal fees cost us $1,217.72! I called SWA Customer Relations the next day to inquire about a refund for the 4 tickets we had to purchase due to the SWA cancellation. We spoke to SWA Customer Relations rep at the corporate office in Dallas TX. He said no refund is given when a cancellation is made due to weather. He said the FAA said there were thunderstorms over Dallas. I shared that I called friends in various locations in Dallas and NO ONE saw a single could in the sky. I shared that ALL other airlines were flying from Atlanta to Dallas that afternoon and evening with no knowledge of storms in Dallas. SWA refused to offer even partial compensation. He said talking to anyone above him would be wasting my time and would not transfer me to a supervisor. I hung up. It was obvious SWA was not going to acknowledge they made a mistake cancelling our flight or even apologize for causing such unnecessary stress and expense costing us over $1,200.00 in additional ticket fees.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Lauderdale to Albuquerque on Southwest Airlines yesterday. First let me say that SWA has always been our airline of choice, but yesterday we experienced terrible customer service, and I do not know if we will ever fly with them again. At the Ft. Lauderdale airport our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We asked to re-rout the remainder of our flights, but we were assured that we had plenty of time to make all of our flights, so we had no need to re-rout. Our flight touched down in Nashville to allow more passengers to board the plane, the flight was then held on the ground to allow passengers that had been re-routed time to board the plane so that they could make connecting flights. We asked for help from the flight attendants, but were told it was out of their hands. When the flight landed in Denver we had fifteen minutes to catch our connecting flight, but the pilot announced that we could not get a gate, so we were held on the tarmac until after our flight left. At this point we went to the gate to ask for help and were told that we were held in Nashville so that many more people could make connecting flights, it was a business decision to hold us up so that more people could make their flights. We were told that we had been rebooked on the first flight out the next morning at 6:50 am (it was 10:00 at this time). I asked to speak to a supervisor because we now had to spend an unplanned night in Denver ""so that more people could make connecting flights, a business decision."" The same supervisor refused to give us a hotel voucher stating that he had already given away all vouchers for the day, but offered us a worthless coupon for a ""discount"" on a Best Western hotel room ($157-unsure when he could have a shuttle pick us up) or a no name hotel for $69 no shuttle. We ended up spending $234 at the Westin on the airport property since we had to be back at the airport for our flight in 6.5 hours by the time all of this transpired. The next day when we got home and claimed our luggage, it was wet, with the clothes inside soaked. In my opinion, if an airline makes ""a business decision"" to inconvenience one set of passengers to accommodate another set of passengers, they are at least obligated to pay for the hotel room of the stranded passengers.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I'm delayed at PCB airport with a baby and have made multiple attempts to get released from this flight and rebooked so I can get my daughter to a hotel and in the bed. We left the upstairs area where we were boarding without knowing we couldn't get back through and although I've spoken to several people here who work for SWA everyone here is telling me they can't help me and I'll have to keep waiting. I've also called the customer service number to attempt to make the changes that way and they to aren't assisting me. All I need to do is rebook a flight for tomorrow and no one has shown any interest in helping me despite the fact that I have a very exhausted and upset child who needs to be in the bed. This has been by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had with an airline and will definitely cause me to reconsider ever booking another SWA flight.

It's no frills, but the customer service is excellent and two free checked bags is even better. I know some people like to badmouth EarlyBird Check In, but I bought it a few days before my flight and got A60 on both trips. Both were full flights and on time, while the return flight was eight minutes early. Considering late afternoon flights from Orlando tend to get delayed due to late afternoon storms, that was a nice change. The captain on both flights kept us informed of any developments and whenever we hit bumpy spots. Only negative things about my flight were the worn seats and the flat Coke I was given. A fairly uneventful flight, which is how I like it. Highly recommend Southwest Airlines.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

We left Atlanta an hour late because the plane was held up for late arriving passengers. Didn't know any airline would inconvenience a plane full of customers who selected a departure time only to be ignored. What could we do? Southwest had us on the plane so we were captive to their whim. Now after an exhausting week, again we are delayed an hour (could be more) leaving St. Louis to return to Atlanta. The most insulting thing about this delay is that there has been a plane at the gate since well before regularly scheduled departure time but zero activity. Zero explanation from SW. I guess they think we don't deserve that courtesy. I'm disappointed, aggravated and wondering why I keep putting myself through this with SW. Beware, time obviously means nothing.

My flights with Southwest Airlines were fine. On the return flight - the copilot actually came down the aisle and introduced himself and wished everyone a good flight - nice touch. My issue came with the connecting gates in San Diego - Gates 1, 1A and 2. The first flight from Sacramento to San Diego - I had to change gates. Much to my surprise, I had to go through TSA security again because you walked from a secure area to a non-secure area. Even though I purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate - I had to toss it because of the 2nd TSA security screen. On the way back - I had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight. Unfortunately, I had to change gates in San Diego - and had to go through the 2nd TSA security screen again. During this screen, I was told I could not keep a bottle of jelly I had purchased in the gift shop (receipt still in the bag) because it was over the limit - how incredibly ridiculous is that? I wasn't leaving the area without my purchased jelly - I didn't break any rules and I was going to be penalized due to SWA sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates. At one point I was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage - seriously? I just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight - how on earth am I supposed to go get my bag? After speaking to the TSA supervisor and making it very clear I was not leaving without my jelly - the TSA agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test. I can't be the first passenger this has happened to and the TSA agents explained they had made SWA aware of this issue but nothing had been done. For goodness sake SWA, use a little common sense and fix this issue. Have passengers who have to use those gates for connecting flights enter a separate area divided by security glass or stop routing passengers to those gates if they are changing gates for connecting flights. The current situation is beyond frustrating and really is inexcusable - there has to be a simple fix and if it isn't a simple fix - you should still fix it because it is a huge issue for your customers. For now - traveler beware - if you are changing gates during travel - avoid the San Diego airport because if your connecting flight is through gates 1, 1A or 2 - you can kiss that water or any gifts you just purchased in the secure area of your last flight that are liquid good-bye.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They have decent seats, and the staff has been friendly and helpful. In addition, Southwest prices are generally fair that customer can purchase tickets in advance for cheaper than most other carriers. They have added some decent flights which were beneficial to our whereabouts. Their boarding process, although different, works well. Fort Lauderdale Airport's Concourse B requires more expansion of rooms and gates because I see the heavy crowd, which makes me uncomfortable to walk. Sometimes chairs are full; you have to stand up, waiting to board. There are few plugs to charge devices. Tampa Airport's Concourse C looks very neat and comfortable. There are many plugs to charge devices. Thus, I have heard Southwest has 101 destinations in the United States and 8 additional countries that its airline connections are expanding. I have been flying often B737, which is great planes with good seats, and I hope Southwest buy more new next generation Boeing planes with more room for legs. Lastly, Southwest Airlines offers internet service using a satellite-based Wi-Fi provider. Cost per device for Wi-Fi access is $8. I know Wi-Fi is not free, and I wish Southwest offer us for 100% free Wi-Fi in order to contact with families and/or friends and watch streaming movies or shows. Therefore, I'm glad that I have decided to fly this airline without a doubt.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WhatsApp-Image-2017-06-25-at-7.44.46-AM-1-50x50.jpeg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WhatsApp-Image-2017-06-25-at-7.44.46-AM-1-500x500.jpeg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WhatsApp-Image-2017-06-25-at-7.44.46-AM-1-500x500.jpeg","","Aircraft

Flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Islip, NY. They delayed us an hour due to weather, 2 hours due to air traffic control, and then 5 hours because the pilot's hours to fly had expired and they needed to find another crew. Found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. They then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. I was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. They refused a hotel, transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. They expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. Meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. I get on the flight for 24 hours later, a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm. I had to reschedule my flight for the following day yet again and they weren't willing to provide hotel, transportation or food once again. So my flight was initially 6.30pm from Fort Lauderdale and we were supposed to land at 9.20pm in Islip. We were given an hour delay due to weather (7.30pm-10.30pm). After the delay, we boarded the plane (7.00pm). They then proceeded to keep us on the plane for over an hour as directed by federal air traffic control (8.00pm). Then they made us sit another hour on the plane demanding that we all stay in our seats and stay buckled because they expected to depart soon (9pm). After this hour, the pilot comes on the PA system and told us that he's reached the maximum number of consecutive hours that the pilot policies allow (9.30). They took us back to the gate where we were given no updates or information for at least 2 hours (11.30). After this, they told us that they were trying to find a pilot and crew to fly the plane. They then told us that our flight would board at 12.50am. They delayed us twice more until they cancelled my flight at approximately 2am. They automatically rebooked me for a flight that would board at 8.30am in Fort Lauderdale and would bring me to Tampa. They would then give me a 10 hour layover in Tampa. I would board the 10.30pm flight to Islip and get back at approximately 1.30am. I waited in a line 3 hours to get this changed and also demanded a hotel, transportation, and food (5am). They hadn't fed us anything but a mini sized bag of mini pretzels and 6oz of water in 13 hours. They refused a hotel. They refused transportation. They refused food. They also told me that they could not change this horrible flight. I went back to them twice and harassed them before they finally put me on a flight that boarded exactly 24 hours from the one I originally had. The woman was extremely snotty and rude to me the entire time. I had to call my friend at 5 in the morning after she, her parents and my parents stayed up the entire night. My friend picked me up at 5.45am because Southwest wouldn't even provide me with a taxi.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

However, this last trip was very upsetting due to the very rude customer service. We had a flight from Chicago to Dallas and then to El Paso which is home for us. From Chicago to Dallas as we started approaching Dallas the weather conditions became difficult and we knew we were going to have delays. It took an hour to land and I completely understand and would never complain about the fact that there are delays due to weather and also due to keeping us safe. Once we landed our next flight was delayed for about an hour. So we hung around and waited. Then it got delayed for another half hour, 45 minutes, then delayed for 15 more minutes, etc. The delays kept coming, then finally they said we were going to board. So they told us they would be ready to board but they couldn't find a pilot. This was at around 11:30 pm. So they kept saying a pilot was on his way and any minute now we will board. Around 1 am I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled. I wish it could have gotten cancelled earlier so we could make accommodations as to where to sleep. I don't understand how you don't have a pilot. And if that's the case, then please just tell us with time so we can make accommodations. People started running to Southwest counters and we were notified that only 2 counters were open. They said you can call and rebook or wait in line at the counter. I called as I waited in line and they told me they could not assist me over the phone because I had a bag checked in. When the counters opened everybody ran to the counter and I had to pick up my 5 year old who was asleep on the floor so by the time I got to the counter I was toward the end of the line. I stood in line until about 3:45 am. When it was finally my turn, the staff was extremely rude. They treated us like we should be grateful they were even lifting a finger for us. The first lady I talked to was Chinese and had broken English. As soon as I walked up she rolled her eyes at me. Before I even spoke. I felt contempt seeing as I was the one who had been standing in line close to 4 hours. But I am a nice person so I decided to smile and be polite anyway. I asked her to please rebook my flight as early as possible and she gave me 2 options: one for 7 am departure connecting at Austin which was already delayed or one for 7 pm direct flight. I told her I was skeptical about the 7 am one since it was already delayed but 7 pm is such a long time to wait when you don't have anywhere to sleep or shower and my luggage is checked in. She gave me a look of not my problem tapped her fingers on the counter and told me to pick one. I asked her if they could help accommodate us so we could sleep somewhere and at this she became very angry and told me ""we aren't going to give you anything!"" She treated me like I was trying to get some ""advantage"" of the situation. I just wanted a place to sleep, and if there's nothing to be done there is a way to state things politely. I told her I needed to think it over and I would come back but really I wanted to not be taken care of by her. I went back in line and got another representative. He was a little bit nicer but he also kept chatting to the guy next to him for long periods of time as if I wasn't there. Maybe the system was reloading or maybe he was just ignoring me. I saw a lot of people crying and I don't blame them.

Dissatisfied with Southwest's customer service policy. Flying today from Baltimore to Providence. Circumstances changed and trying to fly standby on an earlier flight home we were told it would be an additional $125 on a $60 flight. Watched the plane take off only half full. Would have cost them nothing to put us on that plane instead of spending 3 hours in the airport. I am a SW Rapid Rewards credit card holder and would have expected better customer service from a company that prides itself on no additional fees being their difference.

This was the first time I had flown Southwest in several years, never having had a problem in the past. This time was different! The departure flight was delayed 1.5 hours because of a ""plane switch"" related to a mechanical problem. While this was mildly annoying, I did not complain to any staff personnel. The delay on my return flight 2 days later was twice as long--3 hours--and for the same reason. By then, my patience was exhausted, so I asked for more information from the gate attendant. She informed me that our particular scheduled aircraft had not experienced any problem but instead had been rerouted to the west coast from Chicago to replace a plane that had been delayed for several hours while undergoing repairs, in other words, another ""plane switch."" That plane was instead used to ferry us to Wash., DC. Had repairs taken longer, we would have been stuck even longer in Providence, unless Southwest had decided to spread the misery even more. Southwest offered no alternative flights on other airlines nor did they offer a voucher as compensation for the delay. If their planes are so unreliable, perhaps they need to establish sharing arrangements with other airlines or keep planes in reserve for such occasions. Ground personnel were courteous but were apparently unable to offer any practical assistance or compensation for the inconvenience.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

They thought that a $100 per voucher per ticket would be okay. Absolutely wrong. We missed our connecting flight and had issues with our car rental because we were late. On our return flight, we had felt with a rude desk staff at gate 121/122. I had asked if we could use the family boarding due to the fact that one of my brothers had a fear of flying and the other, it was his second time flying. They are 17 and 13. She said nope, he's not 6 and I am not allowing it, the standards are enforced here. I told her the southwest personnel in Boston and in Baltimore understood our situation and allowed us to board with families. She said she was not allowing it what so ever. I asked for a manager she said no one was around. I then proceeded to ask for the customer care line to where she gave me a card with minimal information on it.

Now I had to sit with strangers. We were one of the last to board and it was obvious we were together (tickets purchased together). Not one staff member tried to help and see if they could get us seats together. The icing on the cake was the horrible uncomfortable flight between two larger men. At this point I had fully decided, we would not fly Southwest again. Fortunately this flight was only 2.5hrs. Their flights are cheap, but I will pay the extra to a different airline to be comfortable, and to sit with the people I am flying with. I did notice that they let families flying with children board first which is great! I have two children that I would want with me too, had they been traveling with us.

When boarding my plane, Southwest Airlines requested volunteers for being bumped onto another flight, I was second in line to offer up my seat for $300. Halfway getting onto the plane (I was in the B boarding group), they called me off of the plane. Ten people had to climb over my suitcase while I got off the airplane, and I was told after getting off that they didn't need me to volunteer anymore. Angrily, I re-boarded the plane and was the last person to get on, and had to sit in the only seat available in the very back of the plane. When I got to my connecting flight, I was supposed to stay on the airplane and go to the next city. Upon landing, I was told to get off the airplane and would be moved to another plane at a different gate. This gate and plane change was not the only inconvenience, the plane would now be delayed by 2.5 hours! This would put me in at 01:40am! My husband has to work in the morning and we live nearly an hour away from the airport, so he has to come get me in the middle of the night. My original arrival time would have been at 22.50 or (10.50 pm). The ticket lady told me that the pilot forgot his passport in Cancun? I'm not sure what that has to do with why the plane was over two hours late. This infuriated me. I am a frequent customer with this airline because of their cheap fares.

My complaint is the decline in Southwest Airlines customer service. I'd been a raving fan for decades about SW, now I'm done. The straw that broke the camel's back was me booking travel for my wife to meet me in DC for Spring break. I booked the ticket in January for travel March 28th. When I left four days earlier for DC neither my wife or I received her confirmation, so Saturday I call Southwest. The ticketing agent was great about helping us find my wife's confirmation, she informed me I accidently made it for the 21st not the 28th, and that they recorded it as a no-show. She said usually you forfeit the funds, but in this case purchase a replacement short notice replacement for the date you wanted, the 28th, then M-F call our customer relations team and they will allow you to use the prior dollars spent as a credit for 12 months against future travel. Well today the 28th from my tradeshow I waited over 20 minutes until the agent answered the phone, at 9:15am. She was very terse with me and said it didn't matter what the ticketing agent told me Saturday, that I did have to forfeit the few hundred dollars I spent on the prior ticket I did not use. I said even though I was instructed differently by a colleague of hers? She said yes, and that I cannot be connected to a supervisor as she is the only supervisor.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I went up to the lady when we started boarding and asked her if they called military personnel up yet and she said only if I was in uniform. I've always just shown my ID and then she said ok I'll get to you in a second. She proceeded to let everyone in the first line pass by me while I stood there with my ticket while she just kept looking up at me seeing how embarrassed I was until the last person in the first line went by and then just took my ticket without a single word.

I usually stick with full service carriers, but occasionally fly Southwest on routes where they provide a nonstop routing, such as this. Traveling one way to New Orleans for a sports competition my wife was participating in. Needed to check a couple of bags, using a Kiosk. All in all check in took no more than 5 minutes, despite a busy morning at AUS. Spent time in the United Club, then went to the gate about 45 minutes prior to boarding. We fly often enough with Southwest, so we are familiar with the boarding process, which to tell the truth, if I have to fly coach, I prefer. We always pay the earlybird check in fee, we are always in group A, even though it's not guaranteed, so we always get a good choice of seats. Sitting together, had a window and aisle, row 2, as the flight was not full this morning. Fast boarding, on time departure, quick taxi and we were off. Rainy morning this morning, so take off was bumpy and drink service delayed, but once above the clouds, we were served the usual complimentary drinks and light snacks. 58 minutes later on the ground in MSY, a quick taxi and an on time arrival. Bags were off quicker than American Airlines ever does, even when priority bags are attached. Over all a good value, quick trip, on time, nice crew, comfortable, clean plane. In short the usual Southwest experience.","Unverified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I'm very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. I flew in from Dallas Lovefield to Phoenix Arizona for a business meeting. On my way out of Dallas I found no line. But I did find two female Southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. They were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in, as well as print my boarding pass for me. When it came time to board I was in the B group. That was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. Great since I'm 28-going on 29 weeks pregnant and I may need to get up to use the rest room. I've only flown American and Delta with assigned seats. I hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. I had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. Once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to San Diego I believe. No big deal until the plan begins to get refueled! The fumes were so strong and awful. Fast forward a day, I'm pleased to go home to Dallas, hoping for better luck with my seat this time. Unfortunately my pass says I'm in group C. Even further out from boarding than on my flight in. At our boarding time of 5.15pm we were told that the flight crew for our flight will not even land until 5.45pm, that we may begin boarding at 6.10pm to leave at 6.30pm. This is all a maybe. You would think a company would have better logistics to get their staff here earlier or on time.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Open seating policy. I've never flown Southwest Airlines before today. In fact we're still taxiing as I write this. I was told the night before that there is an open seating policy with Southwest but until boarding I didn't quite understand what that meant. For those of you who do not know, when you check-in you are assigned a zone and a number. This is the order by which you board and from there it's general admission. Maybe that sounds fine until you travel with your wife and kid and realize that you will be forced to rely on the general good will of the 160 people who have boarded the plane ahead of you in order to sit with your family. We were not so fortunate. Even when the entire plane of passengers was bribed with free drinks for the flight, there were still no takers.

I would have never transferred those chase points if I had known that. They are worth over USD800 in travel thru chase.

Traveled from Minneapolis to Phoenix with my wife and 5 kids (ages 1,3,5,7 and 9). It has been many years since I have flown and never for any of the kids. First got to the check in counter and baggage drop off in Minneapolis - not knowing procedure we were greeted right away with a smile and very friendly employee. We were checked in right away and given instructions on where to go and what we would need to do when we got to the gate with our stroller. Proceeded to go through security, again nervous as to how smoothly this would go with all the horrible stories I have heard. TSA agent checking our id's was very friendly and good about telling us where to go and what was expected of us to get though security. Got to the Southwest gate and before I could even get over to the agent he came over asked about the stroller and went back to the counter and came back a minute later with a claim ticket and label for our stroller. They explained we would board after the A ticket holders and wheel chairs as a family. We boarded the plane got to pick our seats 3 on the left side and 4 on the right with the 1 year old on my wifes lap. All Southwest attendants were nice and friendly during the flight. Landed in Arizona and got off the plane with no issues, got to baggage claim and our bads were already there waiting on the conveyor. On our way home it was just as good. Overall I was very pleased with Southwest and their staff. A great price compared to other options.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

No problems. Even though I was the last of about 150 people boarding (having misunderstood the online preboarding process, I wound up having to get my boarding pass at the airport) and had to take a middle seat between two guys, who both seemed to be recovering from chest colds, my 2.2-hour run from Phoenix to Spokane was fine. Nice staff at both ends of the process. Seat not too tight. Neighboring passengers courteous. A fair boarding process. No delays. The price: not a terrific deal (my round-trip ticket between Spokane and Phoenix was just below $500), but not ruinously expensive, and this was, after all, Thanksgiving. I feel positive about this trip partly because of my last flight, from Honolulu to Ithaca, NY. That was via United. United treated coach-class passengers like sacks of dirt. It canceled a flight (D.C. to Syracuse) with no better excuse than that it was under-booked, offered no apologies, made people stand in line for one hour to get alternative routing, ultimately made me spend an extra night in Syracuse, at a cost of about $100. By comparison, this experience at Southwest was wonderful. Until I'm disabused of my faith in Southwest, I'll happily board it again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

They say ""open seating"" makes the boarding faster. It doesn't. It makes it easier on their end because they do not have to spend the labor on seat selections, etc. It is more like being treated like cattle in a chute. When you get to the plane, you are still waiting to get seated, just like every other airline out there. If you are lucky, you might get to sit with your other family members. Our family was not the only one that had to sit scattered throughout the plane. The attempts at humor by the flight staff did not help much either. The seats were cramped to point my shoulders hust from being so scrunched up and I am not that big of a person, 5'10"", 220lbs. The beverage service gets you about 4 sips of your drink unless you order coffee or adult beverage. One of our pieces of luggage was severely damaged so we got a $50 coupon to be used on Southwest airlines and only on Southwest airlines. I think we are throwing it away. They found more ways to nickel and dime more money out of passenger fares.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I said sure not realizing it was the pilot right away. He carried my car seat and stroller and waited in line with us. I told him not to worry and he could go ahead since he had more important things to do, but he waited and seemed happy to help. While descending, our son was screaming so loud, and the lovely flight attendant, came over right away and entertained him until he smiled and settled down.

The employees that I have spoke with thus far have been wonderful.

I put several thousands of dollars on it a year but have noticed that I get a lot less flights with it now. I liked how they started giving you a boarding number when you check in 24 hours in advance so there aren't people arguing about the lines. But now what people are doing is saving seats all the time and it has gotten carried away. I have talked to the flight attendants about it but they say they will not get involved with it. I check in 24 hours in advance on the dot to get the best seats possible but am going farther and farther back from people saving seats now. What the customers are doing is one will get the early bird pass to get an advanced seating number and then save the remaining seats for the passengers that are flying with them. I actually was going to sit down on one flight and a woman said she was saving seven seats which was three rows and I finally said no, you cannot do that since my boarding pass was before them. She started getting loud and the flight attendant was no help whatsoever. I am not going back any further on the plane simply because others are not working with the rules Southwest has determined and does nothing for the people who play by the rules. I know this sounds petty, but I can have A tickets and cannot get seats for me and my wife until near the back of the plane. I tell the flight attendant about it and they do not respond so no more Southwest for me.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

In all my flights, the flight crew has been friendly, and this last round trip flight was no exception. People who work for Southwest in my experience seem happy to do so. The planes are all Boeing 737's and for economy class seating, there is better space than many other airlines. The inflight entertainment is via wifi on your own device, which means no footwell intrusions from IFE boxes or bulky seatbacks. Some people are taken aback by Southwest's open seating policy, but its never been an issue for me. On the return leg of this last flight was on a brand new 737-800, only two months old and still had that new plane smell. Both of my flights left on time and landed early.

This change also did not cost me extra! This was a nice surprise considering is took me 6 months to get American Airlines to acknowledge that they need to reimburse me for a flight I was never on!

Southwest Airlines used to be my favorite airline to fly particularly because of how easy it was to cancel and change flights, their rewards program, and especially how helpful their attendants were. Over time, some of their best value points have changed. Their reward system has made it more difficult to receive reward flights. There was a time that you could show up to the airport early, and if their was a seat available on an earlier flight, they would accommodate you, but they no longer do this without charging you the fare difference which is really expensive on a day of flight. I must say worst of all is their service and customer service. Each Southwest Airlines personnel that you deal with from the time you check in, until exiting the plane is rude or in a bad mood, unwilling to help or accommodate your needs. I have a service animal, and three times, at three different points within one round trip experience I was harassed after being cleared twice. I was humiliated and embarrassed.

Unfortunately, this time around was far from a pleasant experience. Flew from Dallas to Kansas City. It was my first time checking a car seat and stroller at the gate so I wasn't quite sure of the process. The woman 'helping' was rude, and even made a snide comment in regards to me not understanding where to sign the liability tags. We, my 2 young daughter's (1 & 11) and myself, loaded the plane last. I was concerned about having 2 seats together, and the stewardess was less than accommodating. She did say she would find 2 middle seats close together but that was the best she could do. Fortunately, an older gentleman gave his seat up for us to sit next to each other. I graciously thanked the man, and then thanked the stewardess whom then told me not to thank her and that I needed to thank him. Thankfully the gentleman who was collecting boarding passes was the only pleasant encounter I had. He insisted on taking the stroller and car seat for us because our hands were full, and made sure to go ahead of us and tell the flight crew that we would need 2 seats together so they could begin working on it. Clearly the accommodation wasn't taken into consideration but I appreciate this man for being the only thing positive thing I can say about Southwest during this trip.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The employee that seemed to be in charge at the time, taking the tickets grabbed my wheel chair and quickly/aggressively pushed my wheel chair so fast/hard over the turns and bumps in the ramp that I told him twice to stop and slow down. He was rude to customers loading the plane. He left me and walked away at the entrance of the plane (did not secure the wheel chair, lift the foot pads or help get the luggage off of my lap or give me my cane). I was then met by another rude Southwest flight attendant that just watched me struggle to get out of the wheelchair and try to set my luggage down. She did not once offer to help in anyway. I told her I need to get the luggage in the overhead bin and she just stared at me with an attitude on her face/body language. I finally said that my luggage would just sit there because I couldn't put it in the overhead bin. She finally grabbed the bag and put it up. I asked for my cane that was put in the overhead area so I could use the rest room and again with the attitude when assistance was needed. When it was time to exit the plane not one Southwest employee helped any or the 8 disabled customers with luggage or anything. The customers on the flight are the ones that assisted the disabled customers.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I fly this route several times a year and Southwest delivers a fine product. This time we were traveling with our 90 year old father who requires assistance and wheelchair which we requested. The wheelchair was waiting for us at the airport when we arrived and we were assisted by very nice ground staff all the way to entering the plane. We had to gate check his walker which was promptly waiting for us when we arrived in Las Vegas along with a wheelchair and more assistance from the ground crew. It was all very well done. On our return flight we ran into all kinds of horrible traffic delays due to the Presidential Debate taking place just a few blocks away from the airport. The highways and roads were all closed leading to the airport so when we realized that we would not make our flight we called Customer Service, explained our situation and rebooked for a later flight. The agent was understanding, very pleasant and had us rebooked at no charge within 5 minutes. Upon arrival at the airport a wheelchair was waiting and again the ground crew offered great assistance all the way to the plane. We again gate checked his walker and it was waiting for us upon arrival in Reno along with a wheelchair. Overall I was very impressed by the way Southwest worked with us both on the ground and in the air. Job well done.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Southwest doesn't control the wind however, they did make the slightly longer flight highly entertaining. About half way to Seattle, the flight attendants decided we needed to play Blackout Bingo. Seriously funny with the quips from the flight crew including the pilot and co-pilot. The flight crew did everything possible to make the flight entertaining. Kudos to the Southwest crew for going above and beyond to make the passengers enjoy a somewhat long flight enjoyable. I really enjoyed the safety briefing where they said ""In case Southwest Airlines becomes Southwest Cruise Lines"" when showing the safety jackets. This is a ""No Frills"" airline. You don't pay for checked luggage. The price you're shown is the total price without added expense. Yes, I paid $40 for expedited boarding but that was my choice to avoid having a middle seat. If you want to save some cash yet have a fun flight, you can't do better than Southwest.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Because of the switch I was the last one on the plane both times and stuck in middle seats after getting A boarding with the original flights. A Southwest flight attendant though saved the day. On the Denver to Sacramento trip he asked me if I knew the latest score of the Giants-Cubs game. I was wearing a Giants shirt. I said I had to board right before the ninth inning. He told me to log on to the plane's wi-fi, but my phone was near dead and I needed it to get picked up in Sacramento. So this attendant goes back and gets his iPad so I can watch the end of the game.

Because I paid the cheapest fare, I was one of the last people on. Luckily it wasn't a full flight so I still got an aisle seat. The plane was clean. The flight attendant giving the safety announcement, as per apparent Southwest policy, made the speech into a comedy routine (much needed on a red-eye). For those who don't know, the flight from Norfolk to Baltimore usually takes a maximum of fifty minutes; this time it was more along the lines of thirty-five. Despite this short timeframe, however, the crew made sure we all got our snacks and drinks (though I didn't have any). I have usually had good experiences flying on Southwest, and this flight was no exception.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

And to boot the phone agent kept trying to get me to take a standby flight to Las Vegas instead of getting me home to LAX where my car, family, life and all that matters to me are.

We were rebuffed after several attempts to rebook and told no available seating although when you go online there are expensive tickets available later in the day. The gate representative basically said it is not her fault and she can't help us or do anything to compensate us as there was fog in San Diego. If we can't get out today she will try to rebook us tomorrow. We can email to complain and as previous reviewers have said, that's not very effective either.

Looked at prices for other airlines and I saw nothing less than $350 round trip. A co-worker suggested I check Southwest Airlines website since they don't pop up on Priceline and other travel websites and found the same flight for $240. Good first impression there. When I arrived I learned that my first flight from GRR to MDW was delayed 45 minutes as the plane was stuck in IAD - however, the attendants seemed very eager to get us to our destination and boarded those with close connecting flights first so they wouldn't miss them. I was impressed even further by the friendliness of the ground service. Great sense of humor. This was a reoccurring theme on each flight. Planes were clean and well maintained. I understand some of the planes received new seats which supposedly are far superior to the old ones. Wasn't super comfortable but better than any I've sat in on an American Airlines flight. I purchased wifi for 8 bucks and it lasted for the entire day, so I used it on both flights even though I had to change planes. Cabin service was efficient with a large selection of drinks. Attendants were very personable and helpful. I like how they read gate info before landing. Also worth noting that I travelled alone. I can see how their open seating process could negatively effect groups of people traveling together. They do offer family boarding after the A group boards which was neat to see. I landed a first row seat 3 of my 4 flights and it was very spacious but all carry on must be stored above. If you're traveling light it's worth climbing over a few people as the leg room was fantastic. Overall great first impression of Southwest. No large complaints worth noting. Can't beat their prices. It's hard to find good rates to bigger cities when flying out of an airport as small as Grand Rapids. Will definitely fly again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

My flight was cancelled with minimum notice. They had the entire full flight go to the 2 agents at the gate to rebook (they did not even tell people there was an option to go up front to check-in). Being A-List Preferred I called the number and they tried to put me in an open seat on the 1:55pm flight but they could not help because somehow SWA closed making reservation changes to them from flight 37. After the A List plus folks could not help I went to front check in but they had no ability to get me out until the 9:45pm flight. Despite my Business Select fare I got a boarding pass with position B5 on it. When I complained I paid the high fare and was A-List Preferred they said they could do nothing but I could try to better myself (13 hours later) at the gate. They also said if I called back Monday they would connect me with customer service. In addition to going out 13 hours later I had to wait 1 hour to get my bag back and leaving the airport paid $12 for parking that would have been included in my regular parking fee for 24 hours. On Monday I again called the A List Preferred number to be connected to the customer service to complain as I was told Sunday. They instead told me to send an e-mail. You have no idea how frustrating this has all been. Not only did I not get to meet the people I was to have lunch with Sunday I arrived at my hotel well after 1AM (flight landed at 12:20AM) to have to be at my office a 7AM meeting. I did want to talk to someone who will explain why SWA will not let me verbally complain and maybe get SWA to think how badly they handle these situations.

We have been on other airlines where the flight crew were not so friendly and almost rude so it was very refreshing to see some sense of humor in the air especially on an early morning flight.","","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-1733-e1471808566146-50x50.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-1734-50x50.jpeg","; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-1733-e1471808566146-500x500.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-1734-500x500.jpeg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-1733-e1471808566146-500x500.jpeg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image-1734-500x500.jpeg","; ","Type Of Traveller

I have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. My family lives in RI, and I live in NM. So I travel cross country once or twice a year, plus vacation and work trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Quebec, Mexico, and last winter Cambodia. I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines. Over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip, due to lengthy waits in security, and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier, as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway? I can go swimming in Albuquerque. The first such moment was when I got to the airport at 7:00 am for my 8:55 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. It was posted as delayed, now it's just gone. I have to wait until I am called to be told how I will be rerouted. So now I am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later, to make a Dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. So I can still pick up my rental car during daylight. I make it to Dallas, I get on the plane, we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to San Antonio. No we are now waiting an additional hour and 45, due to bad weather. Well, ok, I can still do my drive before it gets dark (I've never driven in San Antonio). I can even get off the plane if I want, I will just have to reboard (because that is so much fun). So it is really pretty hot in here, but it is too late to go home. We can leave now, (so they say). We just have to wait for the passengers to get back on the plane. Did Southwest get new management? Is this a new marketing scheme?","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Yes - Southwest had a computer meltdown and their flights were all messed up. This has happened before to them and other airlines. But alas it always comes down to how an airline handles things like this that differentiates them from others. My nephew is Italian and doesn't speak English fluently and is 14, so I needed to get the Escort pass from the ticket counter. The line was over 1,000 people long if not more, stretching into back halls. I told the SW agents at the line entrances I just needed to get the Escort pass as he can't go thru alone. No - no help. Rude people who just say - get in line. There was no one at the Business Fare line - literally no one - and she wouldn't just let me go up there to get the pass. I had used a Skycap to check his bag in as that line was only 50 people long, so literally just needed the agent to give me the pass. Not a single SW person helped me - but going back to the Skycap - he did! He stopped what he was doing and walked me back to the counter and had an agent quickly issue me the pass. So simple - didn't really stop the process of handling other passengers. Just for this I wouldn't fly SW again - there was no reason the Biz counter couldn't have helped me (and 2 other passengers needing just a quick minute with an agent. So we go thru security - eat and go to the gate where it says ""on time"". Some flights delayed, some cancelled, some on time. They board other flights, at our boarding time they have people line up, flight attendants already on board. Then an announcement: ""Flight 536 is cancelled, we have no pilots, please get in line for rebooking"". No apology - in fact the 4 hours at Midway not a single SWA agent said I'm sorry for what was happening - just deal with it. So I get on the SWA app and the only flight I can get for my nephew is on the 23rd of June. Ok - so now ask an agent how I can get his bag. No - no way, we are not pulling bags from flights. I said he is 14 and has no clothes here as he is visiting. Sorry - we are not pulling bags. I said some choice words to her and then she says to speak to a supervisor. Wait 45 min in line - the supervisor says no - with a smile - and I can try to go to baggage claim and see if someone there would help. So I go to baggage claim - and the agent there is friendly - but she is just guiding people as that line is 20 people long. She said the bag will go to ABQ and just let it go. If I wait in the line they may not pull it, or if they do it could be hours. At least she was friendly. So for 2 days my nephew will not have any of his things - not a dire situation - he can wear my clothes. But again - it was just the sheer nature of the SWA agents. No compassion, not friendly, not helpful. I will never spend a single penny at Southwest again. SWA has gotten too big for its britches - they used to be good in the 80s and 90s, now just one of the Big 4 and treating passengers like cattle. Lets see if the flight tomorrow goes out on time or at all, I have my fingers crossed.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Finally, no other flights available, this flight is canceled all together. All other bookings were available until Sunday July 24th. Useless for us, since we were coming back on Sunday. I shifted gears quicker than Southwest and booked a flight with JetBlue for an additional $1000 to fly out the next day.

For this reason, we have always been willing to pay the extra dollars to book our flights through them, as opposed to booking with one of the cheaper airlines. However, the last 3 times we have flown Southwest have been just awful. They lost our car seat the first time, our luggage the second time, and then the third time we experienced a 3.5 hour delay followed by a cancelled flight at 9.30pm. On top of this, we have encountered terrible customer service every step of the way in dealing with these stressful circumstances. Each time we traveled the personnel working at the ticket counter have been unbelievably rude. Great way to start the trip. When items were lost, instead of being helpful and accommodating, the customer service agent working in lost baggage was very brusque and actually yelled at us, and then refused to do something as simple as validate a $7 parking ticket for my husband who had to park and come in to help me with the situation since I was traveling alone with our 6 month old. Finally, when we were flying home to Denver, our flight was delayed 3.5 hours and then cancelled. The entire time the woman working the gates to the flight was yelling at people and being extremely rude. We all had to wait 1-2 hours in line to rebook our flights, and then we found out the next day when we called in that they never even rebooked a flight for us. We will be leaving 2 days after our expected and paid for departure date. On top of all of this, we have not been compensated for any of these inconveniences.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

He was like well you're still going to need to take a seat. I sat down and said that I'm going to write a complaint about the airline. What if I had children, someone who had extreme anxiety, or another issue. Luckily that was not the case, but they should do something about the seating process. When we purchased the tickets it said entertainment such as tv, movies and wifi would be included. There was not one tv and the wifi did not work.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Out of 20 people in our group we were able to sit together here and there. Additionally, why allow large carry on luggage? It would make more sense to limit the carry on because that is what slows down the boarding process, not assigned seating.

Flew from Providence to Tampa. On the first flight there were 17 wheelchairs that delayed the flight for over 25 minutes. We ended up more than halfway back in the plane despite the A boarding. On landing, hearing first on last off, only 3 individuals required assistance. Arriving early at the airport today I observed six people going to Baltimore in wheelchairs, 3 walked a fair distance to get coffee, afterwards one even ""hobbled up"" to the gate person to make sure she didn't need ""real documentation"". On my boarding later there was a family of 6, one about aged six, pre-boarding. I asked and was told it was a disability issue. Really? Four or five people needed for one teenager or maybe the 6/year old? As a former special needs and kindergarten teacher I get it, but as a consumer I know an abuse of the system too. I will not pay to upgrade and perhaps not fly Southwest again. I don't think the airline will change as long as this is ignored by consumers.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

They have gotten rid of all military benefits. The open seating is ridiculous because you can't even sit with your spouse. As far as I'm concerned it's the airlines way of making people pay extra for an upgrade. Neither of the planes we were on had Wifi, inconvenient for people who have business matters. The check in counter was total chaos and it took us 20 min to get our boarding passes.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I was the last to board because my 2.5 year old had to go to the bathroom as people were getting in line to start boarding. Thank goodness we did not miss the flight. When we boarded (last) there were no two seats left together and an older male attendant muttered ""that's what happens when you board last when you have a child with you,"" as he passed us by. I was greatly offended as I could not control the circumstances. Two kind gentlemen gave up their seats for us. My son fell asleep soon after take off and the window blind was jammed/broken in a half closed position with the sunlight in my son's face. There was a ripped page of one of their brochures so I tucked it under the window blind. As we were about to land, another attendant annoyingly asked, ""Did you rip that? Give it to me"" and took it.

I always fly with Southwest. Their prices can't be beat for the quality you get. I personally like the seating setup, where you choose your seat based on a ""first come, first served"" basis regarding check in time. If you are traveling with young children, they do allow you to do family boarding after the small first round of people, so you can almost always find seats together. Seat room is a bit better than average, but nothing to write home about. Two free checked bags plus a carryon and personal item is unreal. Where Southwest really shines, however, is their customer service. They're funny, helpful, and always seem to be smiling. The flight attendants are especially good with kids. Overall, if you're used to high class flying, this may not be the airline for you as it lacks the preselected seating option and has only one class. But if you just want to be comfortable and have a good experience, I wouldn't choose anything but Southwest.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I hate the competition in boarding. I am heavily pressured by staff to find a seat, but I can't even see what seats are available in order to make an informed choice. (I hardly call that a choice). I hate how people hold seats besides their own for their own purposes, so if you want that seat you have fight for it and sit next to a hostile person.

This was the worst experience I have had with Southwest as I have traveled with them multiple times with no problems. Our first flight out of Hartford was delayed not once, but twice.

My returning flight was also delayed. A vacation that was supposed to be stress free turned into the most stressful travel time I've had.

Because Southwest Airlines does not have pre-assigned seatings, it takes so much longer for everyone to board. Most people leave the middle seats unoccupied as the plane gets filled. So if you have small children, and in our case 2 small children, we have to ask 2-3 people to switch seats so that in case of emergency, we can assist them.

I want to compliment the honesty, integrity, and helpfulness of the Southwest employees involved in getting the wallet returned in tact including the cash and gift cards that were inside. Her wallet ended up in Birmingham, Alabama where I was assisted by two extremely helpful staff. They were as extremely helpful in instructing me how to get the wallet mailed back and gave me the good news that the cash and gift cards were still inside. I don't know if a passenger found it and turned it in or if it was one of the crew that found it on the airplane. All I know is I am impressed how this scary experience for my daughter turned out so well because of the quick and honest actions of the Southwest employees.

This was my first time flying with my 4 year old son, and it turned out to be a great experience. We missed our flight but Southwest gave us a new flight at no charge that was 2 hours later. When it was time to be seated the customer service was very pleasant. I asked a lot of question because it was my first time flying, also my son's. The staff passed out a free drink and peanuts to all passengers. Being able to bring 2 free bags each passenger plus a free carryon was a win-win situation. I was very pleased to have such a pleasant experience. Everything was better than expected.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Flight was boarded then cancelled. Was put on next available flight which also was cancelled. Ended up being routed to Sacramento. Then it cost me more money to get from Sacramento to reno than the original ticket cost. Cost me $40.00 roundtrip just to pick up my bag at Reno airport. Total cost between airport food gas mileage etc around $380.00 Original ticket $222.98 . I'm a disabled veteran on a fixed income. I asked for a refund of the original ticket cost. Southwest took five business days to approve the refund no thanks to there customer service center. After five days I had to call the corporate office in Dallas and was lucky enough to get someone on the phone who could at the least push my claim through to approval status. I got every every excuse imaginable from there customer service reps but the one constant was that this was there policy on refunds and I would just have to wait. They took my money immediately out of my account when I bought the ticket so why is so hard for them to put it back. Seriously the IRS processes tax returns faster than Southwest will process a customer refund. As of this posting I still have not received my refund and with a holiday weekend here I guess I'll be lucky to see it by next week. Shame on you Southwest airlines. I trusted you would have better business sense than to hold peoples money hostage. Your customer service reps are under trained and give different answers.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I paid $8 to have wifi throughout the flight, but any simple google search takes about a minute to load. Netflix does not work on the wifi. After realizing this, I then spent another $5 on a movie to watch. In order to watch the movie in flight, you have to install an app to view it. I installed the app about 13 times, on both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, however I was still not able to watch the movie that I bought. Overall I wasted $13 on wifi services that are expected to work. Very disappointed.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We called Chase-2 and they could not give card number but said if we sign up online we could use the card to book Southwest tickets. We canceled phone activated application and signed up on Southwest online. Account was approved and activated by Chase but could only see the last 4 numbers of account. Security, I get it! So we contacted Chase-3 again and they said we should have had the trip in our Southwest checkout online. I check and we did have the trip in our checkout and still couldn't book the trip. What a run around! We ended up using our DELTA card to book our Southwest trip. We are planning many trips this year so were trying to get the 25,000 reward miles by spending $1000 - no problem!

This time, however, I got better than I expected. The itinerary had a departure from San Juan at 5:40 am with a stop in Orlando and a transfer in Denver. The flight ultimately let us off at San Francisco at 1:00 pm, making the entire trip 13 hours. Fortunately, Southwest featured free DirecTV on an electronic device and movie rentals for $5.00 each, covering entertainment for the first two flights. The DEN-SFO leg was an older plane, so there was no entertainment option. There were no full meals, but the flight attendants had a stash of snacks and refreshments for all three flights. Seat comfort was questionable and there was only one bathroom, but that's the expectation for the airline that sells tickets $400 cheaper than any other. Ultimately, I was quite impressed by the flexibility and price of the flight, and I recommend Southwest to an budget traveler.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations. He then stated, ""Sorry but there is nothing that he can do"". He didn't even try to make it right but rather tried to come up with different excuses. Also he knew very little about the policies as I was placed on hold several times while he consulted with another co-worker. This is what happens when a company loses sight of what made them what they are - and that is the Customer.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer. Customer service is free but it makes all the difference.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

So they knew they had a problem at 6pm. It appears the problem originated due to the St Louis flight not being able to come into Chicago due to sleet and severe weather, hence the Chicago to Nashville leg of the flight was also delayed. The flight we were scheduled for was to come in from Nashville. Southwest is a point to point airline as I was told by customer service today, (after holding for 90 minutes) which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. So know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. We were told another plane was being routed from Dallas to Nashville to pick up passengers and come to Orlando to be our plane from Orlando to Birmingham. The delay was again changed from 10:15 to 11:55 then to 12:55 am. A plane did arrive at 12:20 and we were told it was our flight. Only to be told at 12:50 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to Birmingham after all, so we are now at 12:50 am going to officially cancel the 9:20 pm Flight and we cant get you on another flight till 9:20 pm the next day. My concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 12:55 am and yet no one in command for Southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving Orlando. The customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but I did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. I just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights, delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. Southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. If you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes? Also I would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened. Does not make me want to continue my long tenure with Southwest.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

As soon as we arrived at the airport, we used the check-in next to the parking garage. It was efficient and saved lots of time. At our gate, boarding was in groups. We were in B. We boarded with no trouble. Our plane was a 737-800, with the split scimitar winglets. I loved the plane, and it offered a smooth as can be ride. Beverage service was provided with small cups, but enough to quench my thirst. As usual, Southwest provided peanuts and pretzels. The last time I flew (2013) I was provided 2 bags of pretzels, but this flight I was given crackers and peanuts. The legroom on board was pretty acceptable, normal for a Southwest flight. The landing was the worst part, though. We had to go around to make way for a smaller plane, and as soon as we landed, it was the bumpiest I had experienced. Not that all airplane landings are smooth, but this one wasn't. The de-boarding process was quick. Due to the small traffic and flow of flights, Southwest's baggage claim was also a quick and easy experience.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Not the cheapest choice at all, but quite convenient for travellers departing from an area with poor air connectivity like El Paso. Rapid, efficient check-in, timely departures, fairly organised boarding, funny crew (this should have a limit, though). Wifi is not free but at least you can track your flight using their basic free signal and browse their website. Baggage delivery took a while at LAX, but came really fast in El Paso.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Calm until the guy who walked in directly after me claims the extra leg room for himself. Why me specifically am I not allowed to sit there?

It used to be fun when I was a teenager. It is no longer fun. Southwest Airlines has always had open seating. In 1981, before they had Early Bird check in, I flew to Tampa to visit my parents with my 3 year old. There were NO adjoining seats. The only way I got a person to move was to say they would have to take care of my daughter. I quit flying SW! I started back when they started Early Bird. I am quitting SW again. It is truly a cattle car. Like riding the bus in the 60-70's. Both flights I was 49 with paying extra. I got the last aisle seat on that plane. Early bird does not help if you have a continuing flight which most Southwest Airlines flights are. Also too bare bones. Plane was freezing. No blankets. People were rude while waiting for the bathroom. Said don't stand here. Like where are you going to stand? It is not the airline I knew in the 70's. Even with 2 bags free it is not worth it and sometimes Southwest Airlines is more $$$. Apparently I was dozing on both flights and received no snacks or drinks.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. For us, Southwest is always on time. The flight attendants were very entertaining and worked with precision. This was a nonstop to MKE. Here is the negative, my wife and I paid the $12.50 each for Early Check-in and got positions A-36/37. It didn't mean much. Unfortunately, when they pre-boarded the plane, 33 people got on. About 10 to 12 wheelchairs and their entourage including a puny ""service"" dog. Even the gate agent rolled her eyes at the numbers. So, to sit together on the aisle, we were back in row 19. I can understand wheelchairs pre-boarding. Perhaps people in the entourage who pre-board should have to pay $12.50 each as well.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Both legs of the trip were wonderful. We did upgrade to the Early Bird Check-in and that was only $12.50 more each way per person. We got an A boarding position and had our pick of seats upon entering the aircraft. Both planes were on time and actually got us to our destinations earlier than scheduled. Flight attendance were nice and efficient and pilot was well spoken and friendly when he spoke to the plane about weather, arrival times and such. Seats were very tight, but that was to be expected. Both my husband and I took aisle seats and that makes for easier exiting to bathrooms and such. When we found that the cabin was a little too warm they fixed it right away making the temperature much more agreeable. Snacks were good and coffee was very good! No charge for those on Southwest. Being able to check two bags for no-charge was also nice. I will fly Southwest again and would recommend it to friends and family. Not the big open spaces that you get on some of the more expensive carriers, but a nice, low-key flight that gets you to where you want to go without cleaning out your wallet.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The airport can be full gamblers who lost, or people sad to see their vacations end. The security line and line for the ticket counters can be infinite. On my flight, there was a gate change about 20 minutes before our flight was to board. This wasn't announced until shortly after we were supposed to board. There was some additional delay in boarding and our flight left about 30 minutes late. On Southwest, there are no assigned seats. I elected for $12 for the advanced check in option, and was assigned slot B5 (which is equivalent to the 65th person to board the aircraft). I had no problem finding a seat I liked, window seat near the front of the plane. There was wifi with about 20 live TV channels available on your own device. One thing I like about Southwest is they do not take themselves that seriously. Humor and a laid back attitude is common among ground staff and flight crew. The crew on my flight were attentive and friendly. Southwest also does not charge a bag or change fee. I booked the lowest fare and my fare went down a few times. I was simply able to change my flight to the current fare and a credit is now in my account to use towards future flights. I do not get my money back per say, but I do not lose it either. Try that with any other airline these days. And they still serve snacks.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

All over the airport was reviewing publicity posters which says “Transfarency” by Southwest Airlines which I’m aren’t sure how would that define without providing a minimal customer gratification, which not everyone thinks that money might be the only criteria to check. I’ve been associated with Southwest since long time, but haven’t felt this way where I had to lost valuable time with repeated change/delay in time. Further I was nowhere in a choice but had to wait for hours and hours. At time there were situation with my company where I had backed Southwest for its remarkable service in-spite of contradicting opinions all over. I made all my personal and business trips through this airline but eventually had end up in a situation of bizarre. Expected arrival of journey was 9 p.m and travel home on a emergency, and could't make it because of an undefined delay, In fact I had to drive 9 hrs by road to reach on time, and on return again had faced delay, however I understand weather issues. Nevertheless, such and incident will definitely leave an impression to surf for alternatives.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We went online to get boarding passes and paid extra for early boarding. When it came time to board, there were only four people behind us. Not exactly sure what we paid for. We weren't the only ones that happened to (my partner's seat mates were complaining of it too, mind you they got on early enough to sit together, we didnt). If you don't board early you're stuck with middle seats and grumpy people who don't want you to sit there. One lady in first row piled snacks and drinks in seat beside her. She got away with it. People weren't sure if she was saving the seat. She wasn't. Great airline for rude selfish people, but if you're timid or shy, any other airline will do. I will pay anything extra on any other airline rather than go through that again. Horrible, unethical, airline.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Be warned about Southwest Airlines Early Bird check in feature. It has failed to work for me several times now. Your are required to pay an advance fee, which is supposed to get you a check in spot prior to the 24 hour advance check in. Instead, when checking in after the 24 hour time frame, you are assigned the next boarding place, which by then is far back in line. Better to just skip the fee and log in exactly 24 hours ahead, which we all know is a real pain. And if you try to get customer service to respond, be prepared for a 20 min hold on the phone, followed by a representative who could not care less. Southwest is fast succumbing to the fee-for-everything model, which in addition to their escalating prices, makes them just another airline with lousy service. I've been planning a switch for a time, now feels right.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Great customer service! But to top that, when getting ready to return home, the little one was sick the morning of the flight. We were not sure if he would be able to fly. So we called (knowing that we would be charged to change their flight, and probably a lot) to change departure date and time. When explaining why I was calling, I was told I could change the flight and pay the difference. I decided to give the little one some time and the decide. Needless to say, time made no difference. I called back and talked to a Supervisor who answered the call. She quickly told me due to a child's sickness, we could change at no cost. We checked flights and changed to two days later.

Subsequently, my son who was returning to college the following week was unable to check in for boarding pass since they believed he had not flown the previous week. They wanted $200 more than was quoted on their website during ticketing to get on. My wife spent over 2 hours, including 45 min with a supervisor to no effect. Their response was to call customer relations on Monday morning which is 24 hours after the necessary flight. The bottom line is do not trust or rely on the Southwest Airlines website - it clearly is not accurate and do not expect anyone at Southwest to rectify a situation caused by their incompetence. We have used Southwest Airlines 15-30 times per year for the last 8 years. It appears we will have to return to Delta which offers the same flight for us and they appear to be improving compared to Southwest Airlines which seems to be in serious decline.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

After 5 hours one Southwest Airlines gentlemen walking thru told us we would be on standby with little chance of getting a flight. We we told to come back on Tursday, Southwest Airlines gave little regard and no information to its passengers during this entire process.

This has been getting worse for the last 2 years and now so prevalent we will be shopping other airlines. No more fun, funny staff. They're not bad, just like the rest of the airlines. But not knowing when the plane will get to the destination just doesn't cut it. Lateness and cancellations galore. On the plus side, they still have the best luggage and change policy but it's now being trumped by the deficits. Often their prices range from the best to the worst on scheduled routes.

Our flight was supposed to depart at 1020 hours with a layover in Sacramento and then landing in Portland, Oregon at 1345 hours. At 0950 hours there was an announcement that the flight would be delayed until 1130 hours. This meant that we would not make it to Sacramento on time for our layover in Portland. We went to the Southwest counter and we were told that the only flight we could get on would mean we would have a four hour layover in San Jose and we wouldn't land in Portland until 1915 hours. I explained to the lady that we needed an earlier flight because we were flying to Portland for a family event that started at 1900 hours. She then told me that there was a flight that landed in Portland at 1805 hours, but that was the earliest. So, we reluctantly took that flight. My Fiancee asked about our luggage. She said that our luggage would be on a direct flight and would land in Portland at 1400 hours. I asked her since the luggage was getting there before us where we would pick it up. She said ""Baggage claim"". I understand where baggage is picked up, I'm not an idiot. I just thought since luggage was getting there sooner we would pick it up in a specific area at baggage claim. She handed me the tickets and told me that was it. I had overheard another customer received vouchers so I asked her if we would receive any vouchers for our trouble. She explained that we did not qualify for any vouchers because our flight landed before 1900 hours. We walked away from that counter upset, and promising we would never fly Southwest Airlines again. Deciding that we needed to do something about the lack of customer service, we got back in line to talk to someone else. When we eventually got to the front of the line we spoke to an agent. He explained to us that the flight we had was the earliest he could find for us. My fiancée then explained that we had not received a voucher or anything for our inconvenience. He then gave us two $200 vouchers for future use. We were still upset, but felt a little better about receiving the vouchers. While we were standing near the counter deciding where to go sit down, we overheard another gentleman being very loud and rude to one of the ladies behind the counter. He was on the same flight as us and was upset about not landing in Portland until late at night. Not only did he get on the same flight as we did, but he also received two $200 vouchers and face value for his ticket. I am sure that delays happen often do to inclement weather or maintenance problems and I understand that those problems are out of Southwest Airlines control. It is just very upsetting that someone that was rude and loud received more for his inconvenience than we did. Did we receive less because we were nice? Getting something for a flight being delayed shouldn't depend on the volume of our voice or the rudeness in our tone. This should be about what Southwest Airlines can do to keep customers and what they can do to apologize for missed family events. I am not only upset at the way we were treated, but also the fact that we received almost nothing for the extra seven hours we had to spend at the airport.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Southwest Airlines actually contacted me by phone regarding an upcoming trip in January from San Juan to Canton /Akron. The flight was moved from the early afternoon to 6:45 am. That would present little issue except that we are arriving in to San Juan on a cruise ship at 8:00 am. and could not make the flight. The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport. I called Customer Service and they could not have made it easier for me and were more than willing to accommodate our request. Once again, this kind of service is the reason we keep coming back to Southwest Airlines.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Except, there were a few specific instances in which I was extremely frustrated. 1) There was a delay in our flight (this happens), so we landed as soon as our connecting flight was finishing boarding. We stepped off the first plane (from Las Vegas to Austin), ran to the next gate for the next flight (Austin to DC), and as we arrived they were saying our names over the loudspeaker. We got on the flight and the plane was completely full except for our seats which was fine, however the flight attendants were not very kind, and we all felt that we were blamed for being late. However we have zero control in the matter of the other plane making it to the airport in time for the connecting flight. That was very unsettling, and embarrassing, as this was taking place in front of other passengers. 2) I attempted to connect to the WiFi via Southwest for their entertainment. This is free (yet limited) and there was no warning about that. The connection was also poor, so I decided to spend the $8 on the full-access WiFi. It took me over an hour to connect to this, and I needed certain applications on my phone to watch certain shows which I could set-up until after the flight. Again, there was no warning prior to purchasing that additional applications would be needed. Additionally, the connection was poor and I had to constantly refresh (even after paying), which was extremely frustrating. Generally, very limited legroom, and too long of a time getting snacks/refreshments, but I guess you get what you pay for.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

If you have a flight that connects and leaves after 2pm you will more likely than not miss the connecting flight and be stranded overnight. They offer no assistance in that event regardless of if it was their fault or not and they will never put you on another airline. They offer frequent flights between LAX and SF Bay Area making it popular with business travelers. The problem is that they routinely cancel flights 20 minutes before departure because the flight is less than half full and then send you on a later flight 2 or 3 hours later making it impossible to schedule and attend meetings the same day. Southwest went from the very best no frills airline 10 years ago to one of the top 10 worst now. I wouldn't use any airline now unless they are a direct flight. For LAX to SF Area use Jet Blue, Virgin America or Alaska Airlines, not Southwest.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The plane boarded 3 times before they actually departed. The flight itself was 20 min longer than it was supposed to be. The connecting flight departed 10 min before we landed. They tell me that this is common and they don't compensate for this situation. I will pay for extra bags and assigned seating, because I will fly with an airline that care about their customers instead of putting on a front with fancy advertising.

On August 15, 2015 I traveled from PUJ to MDW. Before departing the airplane, the pilot informed passengers that all flights to Washington were cancelled and to proceed to ticketing. So once I cleared customs, I went upstairs to the ticketing counter and after spending almost an hour in line, I was told my flight to IAD had been cleared. It was around 4:15pm. So they took my baggage and told me to proceed to the gate. I had to go through security again. After spending over 3 hours at the gate, I was informed again the flight had been cancelled. Customer Service said that Southwest had only two flights to IAD on 8/16 and the flights were full and they could get me on a flight on Tuesday. I understand the issue with air traffic control, however FAA stated computers were back in service at 4 pm on 8/15. Southwest only had three to four flights to IAD and my flight was at 8:55 pm. So with only four flights, Southwest could not get the later flights to IAD out? I'm stuck in an airport on standby but the only thing Southwest say is sorry, it wasn't our fault. Southwest needs to do a better job with its flights and with IAD being a major airport, more flights to and from are needed. Southwest also need to branch out to ORD and contract with other airlines to assist in situations like this. Having customers wait for three days to catch another flight without any form of compensation is unacceptable. Offering free baggages and open seating will not keep customers.","","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NormalAppImage6-50x50.png","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NormalAppImage6-500x500.png","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NormalAppImage6-500x500.png","","Type Of Traveller

I never write a review but this was a experience I had to share regarding flight #860 leaving ATL going to SFO. My boyfriend and I fly Southwest all the time, he is usually on a companion pass and I'm usually a reserved ticket. Very few times we've run into overbooked flights and missed connections. I noticed when ever we do hit these bumps in our travel the person at the ticket counter treats his situation totally different from mine. Makes one think - does the type of ticket a traveler has warrant the type of service he/she receives during these traveling hiccups? Any issues I have with my reserved ticket are handled promptly and with a pleasant demeanor. This particular time I was not traveling with my boyfriend and there was a hiccup with the flight. I purposely stayed on the phone while he went from Southwest Airlines employee to employee and every person was rude, and flat out didn't give the type customer service you would expect from one of the most respected airlines. Being at the Atlanta airport from 8:00 am till 4:00 pm and having no luck getting back to San Francisco, I'm sure he was ready to give up. Good thing we held on a little while longer. The ticket agent seemed to not care what type of ticket he had. Her main concern was making sure the customer ended up where he needed to be. Thank you 1,000 times over. I wish I could have been there to speak with someone on the spot. I only wish that the employees at the ticket counter treated all customers the same and handled their flight hiccups with the utmost professionalism no matter how stressed out they may be and no matter if it's a buddy pass, companion pass or reserved ticket. Thank you again.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I don't care where I sit on the plane, however, when I'm traveling with my 10 y/o daughter or any family, it's nice to sit with them. I would rather fly with an airline that assign seats upon check-in than to roll the dice to see if I can sit with my child. My first bag is free but to sit next to my child is $40 per ticket.

After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am. Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Not good for us as we had to connect with an Air New Zealand flight to NZ and the arrival time would leave us rushing to check-in for this flight. Ground staff were very good and got us on to a previous flight due to leave in 20 mins. We made our connection. Earlier in the trip we flew Southwest, LA to Nashville and New Orleans to Phoenix - both flights approx 40 mins late. Also our friends from Canada flew Phoenix to Seattle, same story, about 40-45 mins late leaving. Last Monday, the 13th, our daughter flew from Las Vegas to LA. The plane left 40 mins late. With our future USA trips, we'll be re-thinking our airline travel stategy!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The gate was later changed with no communication, the boarding started with minimal communication. The flight was overbooked or consolidated with other flights and it was extremely uncomfortable.

And they will be reasonably decent to you while you're flying with them. However if you ever need customer service from them it's different - when I called them, it took 112 minutes (no I'm not kidding) to get a human being on the line. When you're panicking because you've realized your wallet must have fallen out of your purse underneath the seat in front of you, and you just want someone to look for it, there will be no help for you. When you finally get a human being on the line, they will tell you to make a report online, and there's nothing else they're willing to do for you.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

On our way back we flew through Southwest Airlines as well and were delayed (without explination) we had to spend the night in Chicago, paid for out of pocket! They tried to help us get a hotel but they booked us one in the wrong airport and almost made us pay for two hotel rooms.

However, today I have just experienced awful customer service. There were two people transferring from my connecting flight from Baltimore to Columbus. Two, would you think that they would have the luggage at an easy to reach area. Now, can't always blame the airlines for this. Lost luggage happens. However, the reason behind my lost luggage was outrageous. After landing 15 minutes early of the scheduled landing time, my flight waited for an hour on the runway. Almost missed the last connecting flight to Columbus. When announced the terminals, they also noted that Southwest is not responsible for your missed flight, if you do miss it. My flight left at 10.10, I boarded at 10. I enjoy Southwest but unfortunately my last couple of times flying with them have been miserable. The other time, I was at the airport for 10 hours waiting on their planes, because they were delayed in the schedule. Again sometimes you can't do much about it, but figure it out!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Return legs were problematic as there was a line of severe thunderstorms over Baltimore causing severe scheduling problems for one of the major hubs for Southwest. Southwest came through and got us back to Providence, albeit two hours late. The terminal monitors in Detroit kept us well informed of delays and the Southwest app (although a bit slow in updating) did also. For the people who complain about the boarding methodology of Southwest, it is a bit strange for the uninitiated, but it works and has worked successfully for many years. If you insist on assigned seating, don’t fly Southwest - simple as that. It is an airline that admittedly has its foibles, but even with that it is still an excellent product! .","","","","","","","","Aircraft

After waiting an hour on the runway we were unable to take off due to a storm that was off in the distance (not a big deal if they were on time however it was their fault for being late and getting caught in the storm).

Many seem to be surprised at SW boarding procedures can't say I love it but at least I understand it. I paid the twelve dollars for a seating upgrade got A-37 out and A-43 back. Got on with plenty of seats and overhead space. If you don't like the charge go on another airline and pay $30+ to check your bag. The trip was fine but airline travel anymore is like bus travel used to be don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed or pay 5 times as much and go first class on another airline. I'm no spring chicken 70 years old and the seats are not great but again it's a bus not an airliner. I did fine would fly SW again if they had the best price and routing I always check around.

It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have to say I will now be flying Southwest almost exclusively because of the free IFE (although you need a device yourself) and the service is great. The 737 is also one of the more comfortable planes in the sky and I would much rather fly on it than a small RJ on Delta or having to connect in Charlotte. Overall I'm very happy with this airline and I look forward to my next flight with them.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore. Do not recommend.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option. Evaluation: do not spend the extra $25 - it is a total waste of money.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Upon trying to return home from Las Vegas my flight was canceled because of equipment problems. There were no other connecting flights that day for my itinerary. As a result Southwest offered several alternatives. We stayed an additional night in Vegas as a result. This was paid for by Southwest. All transportation was supplied by Southwest to and from the hotel. This was first class service! My only peeve and it is a small one was that I had an ""A"" first on pass originally and my replaced flight the next day was a ""B"" category.

First time flyer with SW. Purchased early bird check-in in a bid to protect a better boarding position (and overhead bin space). Was assigned mid-A group so did get the seat location and bin space I was after. The entire boarding process is just a bit too odd for my liking with numbered posts and suspicious-looking 'post squatters.' I didn't need a calculator to know there were some queue jumpers at least within the 'A' group. Seating is just ok I thought the pitch was a bit tighter than the 32"" advertised and while I got the seat location I wanted I ended up with a group 'C' middle-seat'r who felt entitled to both armrests and wasn't exactly on the lean side. The in-flight service was fine the aircraft new and bright the flight crew fairly amenable and the flight left and arrived on time. Just can't get past the boarding system though. It just seems too cattle-roundup oriented.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Seating is a first come first served basis. That's the reason for the line up when boarding the plane. If you can't get your boarding passes together then don't expect to sit together. Southwest needs to make an announcement at the beginning of the boarding session to ensure that people know this.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Boarding started on time on the way back from Montego Bay however after a third of all passengers had boarded the crew found out that 3 seats were non-operational. The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago.

The International line was shorter so we were able to process through in a reasonable amount of time. It was a nice flight with no problems. For our return trip the hotel staff recommended that we get to the airport three hours early. The check in process was very well handled and we even went through the United States Customs before boarding the plane. This made it very easy when we arrived in Baltimore to grab our luggage and go. The return flight had the best flight crew I have ever flown with.

We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be. I do know that I will never fly Southwest again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Even after the bags arrive the Southwest team member usually is to busy to announce baggage drop until 4 or 5 bags have arrived. You spent a lot of money to rebuild that airport you would think that you could make the bags arrive in 20 or less minutes.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Use SW for short non-stops but even those are becoming intolerable. Flight attendants show up after boarding time. Apparently unconcerned that delay 150 or so people so they can have 10 more minutes to do whatever. Rude instructions when boarding. Told to put my bag in bin down the aisle despite having space above my seat ""to save room for other bags"" unbelievably stupid as I have to go against traffic to retrieve bag now. They've gone from a ""cattle car"" (based on their Southwest origins) to a chicken coop. They advertise heavily ""bags fly free"" - didn't know they meant they would treat live human customers as baggage.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

After five flights within the same week all I can say is Southwest isn't what it used to be. For a 6'5"" 200 lb person the new seats are sheer torture. And on every flight I encountered too many passengers being crammed in to too-small planes. It's no surprise that every logistic being run on such a razor's edge makes for a stressful experience. God help you if you have to endure any connecting flights. The schedules are so tight now that they have no time to even clean the planes between boardings and there are lots of delays. What a terrible atmosphere we encountered. The staff tries their best to pretend they aren't running a grim cattle drive but no one is fooled. I guess corporate has decided to maximize volume and profits over any considerations of passenger comfort. Too bad. Southwest used to be different from the sleazy mentalities running most other airlines.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Over the years they have become our ""go to"" airlines. That's why the first time there was mechanical delay we didn't let that impact our view of the airlines. Then in the same week we had another mechanical delay. Now don't get me wrong I would much rather them find out problems while the aircraft is still on the ground! Today ( all delays have been within the same week and half) there is another mechanical delay! This makes three in a short time span. What's going on with Southwest airlines aircraft? As I said before I would rather find problems on the ground but three delays on three different aircraft's all mechanical issues is reason for concern! It turns out a mechanic accidentally opened up the bathroom sewage and it poured out into the aisle of the plane. No one is getting on that plane anytime soon!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They claim there is no assigned seating but you can purchase ""Early Bird Check- in"" which they claim automatically checks you in 36 hours in advance instead of the usual 24 hours. So I purchased the Early Bird check in plan thinking that my whole family would be able to sit together. (Group A-so I thought). Surprise when I received my boarding passes we were in Group B which means you have less that a 50% chance of your family seating together. I called Southwest and was told that the Early Bird Check in does not guarantee anything it just gives you the best available boarding at that time Well they didn't tell me this when they took my money. So in order to ensure that my family would be together I had to spend more money and purchase First-In boarding passes (Group A) for an additional $40 per person (One way). The plane was small cramped no room to even think about being comfortable. I am an average size man (5'11 195 lbs). I can't imagine how someone bigger must have felt. Then imagine my surprise when the flight attendant announced to the final group of people boarding (Group C) to take the first available seat because they were saving the seats in the back for families so they could sit with their children. Twice I spent money to guarantee my family would sit together because they claim there is no assigned seating and now they are saving seats for families so they can sit together Are they serious!! Either you have assigned seating or you don't. Which is it? It is clear that Southwest doesn't have their act together and I believe they are not worth the hassle. I won't fly them again and certainly would not recommend them to anyone.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. Although I was aware that the Southwest boarding system was different I had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. Long story short: whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. I needed to travel within the last few weeks from St Louis International airport to Washington Dulles International airport. I would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. In order to get a better seat on the airplane I paid the extra money for a business select ticket. This puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. Southwest seating is first come first serve. On my way to D.C. the system worked well enough although on my first flight I did not get a great seat as I was boarding in position A15. That didn't bother me much the system had worked as designed. My second flight I was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. However on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. The problem started when it was time to board after a layover at Midway airport in Chicago. Now I first want to say that I support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to pre-board. But I do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. My ticket from Midway to St Louis had me boarding in position A1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for pre-boarding. There were four pre-board passengers ahead of me. When the gate agent called for pre-boarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. Not acceptable. By the time I got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. The four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. Why can't Southwest declare the front row an ""exit row""? It is an exit row! That would prevent pre-boarders from sitting there. What did I pay extra for to get priority seating if Southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people? In the end: I paid and they did not deliver. I recommend that if you choose to fly Southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. I personally will not be flying Southwest again under any circumstances.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I paid the $25 for my sister and I to do the early bird check-in which I will always do from now on. We boarded quickly and took off on time. I enjoyed sitting up front on the way to Phoenix (I'm claustrophobic so the extra room made for a more comfortable feeling overall). Coming back we were a few rows back and it was cramped for sure. That's to be expected on a smaller jet with smaller seats. For a domestic flight it's doable. What I was really impressed with was the overall attitude and presence of the crew. I have always flown Delta in the past and was surprised to see the pilots before the flight. The flight attendants were very nice. The flight back to Atlanta was interesting as there were weather issues but the pilot did a great job of navigating around and through the worst of it I believe as there was hardly any turbulence. I'll fly SW again for sure.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Both flights were excellent. Most probably the friendliest staff and crew I have come across on any airline. The emergency demonstrations are witty and funny and do not sound like a robot that does not want to be there. They also offer free beverages and a small snack on board which is a nice gesture to get you through a short flight. There are a very efficient airline. We had no delays and baggage was returned quickly once off the aircraft. I would recommend Southwest to anyone flying within the US. They are truly cheap and cheerful.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carry-ons. We never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane. The attendants in the front of the plane (a male and female) did their job and that was about it - bare minimum. From the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy. I noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that I overheard.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable. Unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats. Rarely are they late. The staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily. Airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees. Plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive. Airline miles are so easy to use including international. This airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service. Definitely a loyal fan and steady customer!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Staff must've taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took (there were 4 total for the round trip) all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. They looked like they ""had"" to be there. An elderly woman who couldn't sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that (because of their no assigned seats policy) was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then I saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. Come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them? Our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it. The seats are comfortable enough but there is no perks to paying the extra $12 a ticket for the early bird check in unless you are just partial to a window seat. I got A30-36 boarding most times which is after the first A group picks all the leg room seats. The only thing I like is that you can control whether or not you sit in front of kids if you don't want to you find a seat in front of adults already sitting.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I haven't flown on Southwest in about a year but my experience on a recent round-trip from Phoenix to Boston with connections proved repeatedly how flyers are abusing Southwest's boarding process. On the first leg I was assigned B38 since I did not pay for EarlyBird seating although I did check in exactly 24 hours before the flight. By the time they got to B31-60 practically the entire flight had boarded. At least 20 people were in the pre-board category about 5 A-list flyers who hadn't gotten an A number boarded after all the A's were called and then another 26 people boarded during ""families and children"". There were less than 30 people remaining to board the plane (which was entirely full) by the time they got to the B31-60 category - when technically there should have been 75-90 people left to board. This experience was repeated on all four flights and was worse when leaving BWI when a group of ""C"" pass holders snuck into the B segment and were not stopped by the gate agent. The final straw was the flight from Chicago to Phoenix. I watched a family walking through the airport to check-in at which point the parents asked for a wheelchair for their young daughter - who had been walking with them up to that point. A wheelchair was commandeered and they were expedited through the TSA check-point. Lo and behold when I arrived at my gate weren't they there - and with a pre-board pass. So clearly another way to bypass Southwest's procedures is just to commandeer a wheelchair and then you get to pre-board. It really is time for Southwest to just start assigning seats; the flying public it has been demonstrated will otherwise continue to outmanoeuvre and get around the ""rules.""","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The loaded and unloaded all luggage for what was later explained to us as an ""oil leak"". This whole time the pre-board passengers were still on the plane with no air what-so-ever. After 15-20 minutes they boarded the rest of the passengers. They then told us that the AC wouldn't properly work because the engine was too hot so we all sat cramped in our seats sweating for the two hour flight. No moving air at all.

Our connection flight had to be rescheduled by Southwest and by how they scheduled it we had only 30 minutes to make our next flight which turned into 2 minutes when the initial flight was delayed by the airline. Needless to say we did not make our flight. What should have been a five hour travel day turned into an all day travel day which was very long and tiresome for me especially since I am eight months pregnant. It would have made the experience a lot better if Southwest would have somehow reimbursed us for some of the flight or offered us a discount for future flights since the delays were of no fault of our own. The flight attendants were nice and the people at the ticket counters were overall nice but overall the travel experience was very disappointing. Not a fun way to start our babymoon vacation.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Throughout the 2.5 hour flight I was bumped progressively harder in my shoulder 8 times by the only female flight attendant on staff. Never once when she was walking towards me from the front. Always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. Never once an ""excuse me"" or a turn around to see what she'd just hit.

The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight. But if you don't show up for the flight they have no problem taking your money with no refund or accommodation.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We noted our layovers in Houston and Kansas City and planned on getting food during the stops. When our first flight landed in Houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight. Same thing happened in Kansas City. There was no optional food we could purchase. We were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl. We had also planned on purchasing WiFi to have our daughter watch Netflix which was also unavailable. Insult to injury the last leg of the flight when I went to change my daughter's diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing.

For many years SW was the only airline we wanted to fly because: on-time schedules nice staff/crew all around good operation. Recently (week of May 8-15 '14) my family experienced sub quality performance from SW (flights from Dallas and Albuquerque to Orlando and back). Schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said ""we'll fly when we fly"" (weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place. Flying out of Orlando was a total fiasco. The flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ""on-time"" departures when in fact the departure time had already passed. Travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet. Finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards (the SW rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldn't say when the flight would take off). So 3.5 hours later our plane takes off. Connecting flights of course didn't happen because our flights were at the end of the day. In Phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to re-schedule. We were lucky enough to find one ticket rep (Homero) who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance. SW offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the night-the info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pick-up available. My conclusion is that perhaps SW has gotten too big (with Airtran acquisition) and has lost control of some operations. SW is at its best as a short haul regional airline. Cross country flights (3 hours +) are off schedule and uncomfortable. The good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they don't have the information and support that they need.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This is my first time to write a review. We flew from Little Rock to Las Vegas. On the way back we were late to board and missed the flight. They put our luggage on another plane and couldn't guarantee when they would get to Little Rock. They put us on a flight to Chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on. From Chicago we got a plane to Little Rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again. We were about five hours or so later than if we hadn't missed our original flight. All I can say the Southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to Little Rock our luggage came in about forty-five minutes later. All I can say about Southwest is good. The flight attendants were very nice too all of them. When we came into Las Vegas the plane went over the Hoover Dam with a very good view I made a comment about the view when I got off and told the pilot I was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks. A little humor thrown in. When I fly it will be with Southwest I have never had any trouble.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats. Although the staff was affable and tried their best I found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for Business Select.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Vacation to Cabo 3/1/14 with connections in Denver. 1 hour late getting off ground in Milwaukee as plane was over weight and they had to kick 8 people off. Late arrival in Denver forced mad rush to gate in different terminal for connection to Cabo. Returning to Milwaukee 3/10/14 plane was 1 hour late getting in and leaving Cabo which again created havoc in Denver for connection back to Milwaukee. The absolute kicker is they lost both of our bags going to Cabo (30 hours before returned) and returning to Milwaukee (36 hours before returned). Unbelievable incompetence. Your bags fly free - you just don't know where!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Booked with AirTran but transported by Southwest from LAS to ATL. Biggest problem I have with Southwest is no seat assignment. That's why I picked AirTran. With Southwest I feel like I'm treated like cattle and herded through the process of boarding the plane. I believe AirTran has the right approach for boarding. That is 1) assigned seats and 2) boarding by zones. I can't understand why the general flying public tolerates Southwest's cattle call boarding. Southwest's prices are right but their anywhere you want seating is for the birds.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up. It took another 36 hours to get our bags delivered to our home.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As usual so many people have to bring their suitcases on board with them these days that we leave late. We get to Houston and our connection flight is down they finally get it fixed and we leave out almost an hour late getting into Dallas only to hear they don't know where our luggage is. We later find out that the plane had a lot of freight so they made us wait an hour for our luggage. I live 8 hours (by car) from Dallas and 2 hours from Nashville. Had I driven to Dallas I would have arrived at my hotel 2 hours before I actually got there by flying. On the return trip our flight from Dallas to St. Louis was late and I had to run to my connecting flight to get there before the door was closing. I think this airline is slipping so I intend to start looking at others after always using Southwest without checking.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We booked Southwest mainly because of the price and I was a little apprehensive about avoiding the dreaded middle and getting a decent aisle seat. We paid an extra fee for their ""early bird"" check in which in our case allowed us to board with the first 25 passengers both outbound and return. It was a 3 hour flight and that's about all of the time I would want to spend in their cramped uncomfortable seating. But for a reasonable short flight I'd book Southwest again. It's a basic no frills airline with no baggage fees and it gets you there albeit not in the most comfortable circumstances.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They have squeezed two extra rows into a 737 to increase profits at the cost of customer comfort. I am 6'2"" and had my knees crammed against the seat in front of me. SW did offer an ""upgrade"" at check in - access to rows A 1-15 - but that would have cost my wife and me an extra $500! In addition to lack of leg room the new seats barely come to mid- thigh further increasing my discomfort. The touted benefits of no baggage fee (one bag apiece) and friendly staff are no compensation for hours of discomfort.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service. And while I was given B51 on the earlier flight to LAX I still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating. Checking in early is key!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

In fact I hardly ever fly with any other US carrier. This does not mean that I love the airline merely that by US standards it is not bad. Some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun. This was especially the case on both flights I took on 28 October from San Francisco to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Minneapolis. The crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long Osaka-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight the day before. At times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights I took with them on the 7th of October -- Minneapolis to Phoenix Phoenix to San Francisco. Surly crews with terrible service. Those two flights drained me more than the flight to Hong Kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined. Most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable. Despite the hits and misses I will likely continue flying with Southwest Airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic US carrier.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It turned our two hour flight (that I was looking forward to closing my eyes and relaxing) to one in which I was looking at my watch frequently anxious for the flight to end. Disappointing for sure!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

All three were delayed with times ranging from an acceptable 20 mins to a nail biting 75 mins delay which meant we almost missed our connecting flight. Gate agents were all friendly and kept us informed. On board was a different matter with rarely a smile from the flight attendants. Southwest used to be so different from the competition but I don't think this is the case anymore. Free checked bags is certainly an advantage though.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful. I don't think I will take SW to New York especially via LaGuardia ever again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

In Group B I was one of the first people to board the plane. When I heard my group being called I stood in line in the right number section that was written on my boarding pass. Following the people in line in front of me I presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way I never want to fly Southwest again. As I presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. Instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. She instead grumbled this isn't your group. Please wait to board when I call your group. Confused I replied is this group B?” She stared at the pass for a while and responded “Oh I thought I called the wrong group!” And finally let me board. This frustrated me as the attendant didn't make eye contact with me the whole time we were talking. The captain and crew members were unprofessional and laughed many times over the main speaker when making announcements. My flight was on Sunday around 10.30am departing from Vegas. Not such a great way to end my vacation.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A.

More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively. I have found that the best way to avoid said delays is taking one of the first few flights of the day avoiding delays that seem not to stem from weather/mechanical issues but rather confusion that just seems to pick up steam throughout the day.

Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes.

I have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that I have had with SWA in the last 2 days! The weather has been good! If you want to save money and don't care about things like arriving/departing on time they aren't that bad. Also I am not a fan of the royal rumble/every man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight. I sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filled-to the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop. Putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasn't a blast either.

Unfortunately problem was not fixed and flight was canceled 4 hrs after scheduled departure. We were re-booked and arrived 6 hours late. While I understand mechanical issues happen such a long delay is unacceptable on a short 1 hr flight such as LAX-LAS. Southwest should have been able to swap out an aircraft at a major hub such as LAX. Prompt re-booking when the problem was first discovered could have got passengers to their destinations sooner. Otherwise cabin was clean and In-flight service good featuring pretzels peanuts and complimentary soft drinks. The new ""Evolve"" seating is uncomfortable and cramped with 31"" pitch. Admittedly such a lengthy delay is not customary for Southwest but their overall punctuality and cabin comfort has deteriorated in the past few years.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I can always judge the best and worst of airlines based on their customer service during their redeye hours. Airlines staff have always been friendly and accommodating. My partner for example was feeling ill after a trip and he was granted an early boarding pass after explaining his situation to the boarding crew. You also can't beat two free bags and no change fees; I was able to use the funds from a canceled flight towards another. Rewards program is pretty good too especially if you have a Southwest card.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Boarding process as someone here said is a cattle car thing they board by groups and family traveling together in different groups start scenes on the gate it delays everything. Onboard crew not well groomed I had the impression they hated being there. The more I fly American legacy carriers the more I stop complaining about Brazilian airlines.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We were delayed a few hours on the Nashville-Newark trip due to bad weather but were kept informed at all times and we were impressed by the good humour and personalities of the flight and cabin crew. Definitely worthwhile checking in online 24 hours prior to flight as you can get a good position in the queue for boarding. Overall a great budget option comparable to our home grown equivalent Virgin Australia. We were rewarded with a $100 travel voucher for the delay from Nashville also - much appreciated. Would definitely recommend Southwest.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Excellent value for money and definitely a winning proposition hands down when compared to flying from Pearson (YYZ). Both legs arrived before time. Efficient operation with crew (both apt and air) always on the ball with updates. On the return leg they scheduled a Boeing 737-900 (bright and with lots of overhead cabin space) to accommodate the additional load due to storm cancellation the day before. BUF and MDW do not have the best options for food but you can always find something ok. Don't count on much for breakfast at MSP if flying out early.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected. Definitely something WN may have to work on.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Plane was full ran out of overhead bins people were grumpy seats seemed really tight and just overall was not a very good experience. I was willing to pay extra for ""business class"" but they were already taken. I might be in the minority however I will gladly pay a little more for an assigned seat plenty of overhead and a slightly less full flight on some of the other carriers that I fly on a weekly basis. This is not an airline for business travelers. Hopefully I won't be seeing myself on a SouthWest flight anytime soon.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Online check-in and bag check has been painless crews have been friendly and occasionally even entertaining and all flights have either been on-time if not a little early. Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights. Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point. Also on the most recent DAL-STL leg I got stuck with a B boarding pass despite paying for EarlyBird. Otherwise no real problems at all.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Southwest is definitely a mixed bag. I guess if you have a small barking dog it's great for you. Unfortunately if you are stuck on the plane in the vicinity of this yapping dog which yapped incessantly for the entire flight it's not so great. If you were lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket that's wonderful but if you end up with ""C"" like I did that means you are forced to fend for yourself to try and find space in the overstuffed overhead bins. Since I don't check baggage and can never seem to be lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket I'll only fly Southwest out of sheer necessity. It's always a free-for-all stampede of confusion-in this case the flight was overbooked so you've got people milling about unsure what's up. The space for standing in line for the flight is ludicrous since the line is largely ignored by most-like standing in line at the movie theatre for tickets-all of a sudden people just happen to show up to join their party and cut in front of you without an excuse me or any kind of courtesy whatsoever. Flying on Southwest is like getting on a bus-no assigned seats. You definitely feel like part of the herd only difference is you do get a couple of packages of peanuts and a cold drink from a smiling flight attendant.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne. I still recommend SWA to my friends and relatives for short non-stop trips.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It took me quite a while to find a seat on the plane and neither my wife nor myself could sit with our very young daughter in the end. Before the return flight my wife had to get something out of her luggage so we asked an employee if she could get it for her. The woman rolled her eyes at us and scoffed before calling someone to get our luggage. The problem with this airline didn't end there.

My experience with SWA yesterday restores my faith that someone cares about passengers. A four hr delay at Midway - airport staff were apologetic and sincere the crew were accommodating and we received an unexpected $100 voucher. SWA used to be the cheapest but the fares have gone up. I believe to cover free baggage. But in our case it was cheaper because the fees on the other airlines made their flights higher. I know their are a lot of complaints about seats. I used to hate SWA for that reason. I also don't like that the 24hr checkin still gives you only an A30 at best since they sell the first half of the A seats now for business select or a fee. But if you check in early you still have a good selection. The other airlines are sneakier. You may get an assigned seat but do you really have a choice? Most of my recent flights have shown me a chart selection of all centre seats and the aisles and windows for sale! Not a good way to build loyal customers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Southwest usually has the cheapest fares and the fact that bags fly free. Their ""Open Seat"" boarding policy is a little different since they are one of the only airlines that have this policy. I do see both sides of the arguments where you like to know where you seating upon booking the flight but also love the freedom of choosing your own seat as you get on the plane. The earlier you check in the better the chance of getting the seat of your preference. I hardly ever experience rudeness from staff. Flight attendants often add in comedic little quips in their safety instruction demonstration which I saw as quite amusing.

After waiting in the line for an hour with 5 kids and hearing other passengers leave the line being told they would not get a flight for 2 days I found a hotel and rented a car for the night. In the morning I called SW to ask about rebooking our canceled flight. The agent told me I had to go to the airport to get someone to do it for me. She confirmed that my only option to get on a SW flight would be to drag 5 kids to the airport to wait for the next available flight in 40 hours and hope we got on that one. That is not a reasonable option so we rented a minivan in Denver and drove to Chicago. SW also lost our luggage. Multiple attempts to call resulted in no one helping us. When we arrived in Chicago went to Midway and the bag was sitting there. I am so frustrated with an industry that is all take no give.

Once we got the Vegas airport we noticed a very disgruntled vibe. The usually happy Southwest employees were very grouchy and seemed bothered to be there. We boarded the plane actually got the very first seat with tons of leg room and finally had the opportunity to stretch out for the long ride home. From the moment the plane was to take off the complaining started. I guess there was some sort of issue with the transair merger and the flight attendant union because that is all I heard about for the entire flight. They just went on and on as if they were out for coffee at some cafe. I don't even think they realized how inappropriate it was to complain while they were on the job and within earshot of customers. It made us very uncomfortable and annoyed. Once we landed and all of bags didn't make it that kind of sealed the deal for us. No more Southwest. Beware when you check your bags you may not see them again. We did get our bag back at midnight so we were the lucky ones.

So whether you print your boarding pass early or late makes no difference. At the airport there are no instructions about the boarding process. So finally I stood in line with the rest. On my return they had 2.5 hours delay the excuse being the weather in Houston. On the return trip the flight attendants gossiped and laughed loudly like 2 schoolgirls preventing us the exhausted passengers from getting a bit of rest. All in all do your best to avoid Southwest even if you pay a little more.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Of course SW is known for the several special ways it rises above the competition: consistently cheap fares (at least for our route) those two pieces of free checked baggage and the free reservation changes. Easy to use website is another nice advantage. As I mentioned among us we will likely be doing 6 or more round trips on this SW route each year for a while so I will be sure to review again if any of the above changes.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Good fares pleasant staff on-time for the most part and when a delay comes up we are informed. This trip held true to that again. But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really. Just remember to buy a meal before you get on a long flight and if you don't mind a long flight on a small plane then Southwest is the way to go. Plus you can't beat the two free check-in bags.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircraft's clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline. Over the past couple of years I have flown 7 sectors with them and my only complaint is with the ground check-in staff. They are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. The check-in system is different to what I am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when I was not sure how things worked. Would I fly with them again probably not there are a lot of other airlines competing for the same business.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My wife politely asked if any passenger would be willing to move so our son could sit with her and no one responded. The flight attendant did not attempt to assist us despite witnessing our dilemma. Fortunately a sympathetic passenger finally offered to move to allow my wife to sit with our son. It appears Southwest has decided that 5 year old children are sufficiently mature to sit apart from their parents on 3 hour flights.

Latest casualty is the previously elegant Rapid Rewards program which used to be 16 credits=1 free flight virtually no restrictions. It has now devolved into just another points system with ever more restrictions. During the transition they are still using Awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight. But do not convert points into an award - if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points. Found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had ""no"" award seats available. You could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award I didn't have enough points available and Southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers. They make no statement that I could find that such conversions are irrevocable. In other words if you make a mistake too bad - you can pay for a ticket but Southwest won't help you correct your points v. award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it. Yes the award expires though the points do not while you continue to generate trip activity.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Cannot understand the open seating ""gimmick"" this airline uses. On the return trip we were not able to participate in the competition to call within 24 hours and get an ""earlier"" boarding assignment as we were travelling in a remote area with no cell coverage. Therefore as we were among the last to board we (and many other couples) were not able to sit together. The flight attendants ""helped"" by continuing to instruct us to just ""find a seat single seats only available"". We ended up separated by 20 rows. The reason for this practice must have something to do with saving the airline money because there is no apparent benefit for passengers. But the on line seat selection process that all the other airlines use is obviously computerized and can't cost much if anything to oversee so why does Southwest do this?? Certainly feels like one of those brilliant ideas the management team comes up with that blindly ignores the needs of some passengers. Won't fly Southwest again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I would not pay the 225% extra for the BS fare versus the wanna get away fare due to what you receive for that increase but work takes care of it as it is for business. The free drinks are nice even on short hops form BWI to ORF in BS. Only major complaint to Southwest Airlines do not board anyone ahead of Business select class unless they pay the same fare or please place them in rows 4 and up. When you pay $230 for Business select you should board the plane before anyone else especially if they only paid ~$89 for their ticket.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The flight to Providence RI still arrived pretty much on time despite the blizzard. Southwest delivered my bags to my door the next day. Everyone was courteous from check-in to arrival. I thought this was excellent service and much better than service I have gotten on the major airlines when things go wrong.

Yet some time between then and the flight the gate had changed to 23. If I had not struck up a conversation with the gentleman setting near me I would have not know until I had missed my flight. My suggestion is with your computer system you should know if a passenger has checked in before a gate change. Please make an announcement at the old gate of the change.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The boarding process is far smoother than in Europe and although the flight was only an hour long we were served complimentary soft drinks and peanuts/pretzels. The outward flight was on time and return delayed 20 mins or so. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly and safety announcements were light hearted and funny but got the message across - we probably paid more attention to these humorous announcements than we would have to the regular dry offerings.

No wonder the bags fly free Southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them. Now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they aren't responsible if your golf clubs don't arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit. Also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didn't even complete it properly. It is nice to try to make flying fun but I think that they are crossing the line. Not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane. They used to be my favorite airline but not anymore. They are not always the least expensive and definitely lack customer service.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The next available flight was 2 days later as all other flights were booked out due to the cancellations. While I was really frustrated with the situation, EasyJet did all they could to ensure our 2 extra days in Amsterdam were comfortable.

I bought a drink and the cabin crew member walked away without rendering the change. I had to call one of his colleagues and even then I was given the wrong change and had to challenge it.

I think that our recent experience clearly illustrates the difference companies like easyJet have made as far as foreign travel is concerned: we have just had a very enjoyable week’s holiday in Cyprus for less than it cost for just the flights on our first visit there over 30 years ago. On that occasion we were going to stay with friends and to reach Cyprus as “cheaply” as possible we had to drive to Heathrow, stay overnight and then travel via Budapest with a seven-hours’ layover in the airport there. Last week we had an hour’s drive to Liverpool and direct flights for two of us for a total of just over £140! We were not sure how we would cope with flights lasting 5 hours each way, as we normally restrict ourselves to 3 hours or less, but we equipped ourselves with plenty to occupy the time and the journeys were relatively painless. Both flights departed and arrived pretty promptly, cabin staff worked hard and efficiently without going over the top and the cockpit crews kept us informed. The plane on the outward journey had the new-style seats which we do not find particularly supportive though they were tolerable, but we were more comfortable on the return flight with the older, more thickly padded seats. Possibly the boarding procedure could have been handled better at Larnaca, but that might have been dictated by the airport rather than easyJet staff. One thing in particular struck me: the totally calm atmosphere on both flights – everyone seemed to be engrossed in or by whatever entertainment they had brought with them to pass the time, an indication perhaps that most clients know what to expect on an easyJet flight and are content with easyJet services, even if they do not bother to say so.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I checked on line 5 days before our departure. Unfortunately I did not realise that my son who is 4 years old was allocated a seat separated from me from the aisle. Once there, I asked the steward if there was anything he could do, since my son starting crying and was refusing to sit next to a stranger and fasten his belt. The steward told me that if I wanted that I should have checked in a month in advance (!) or pay extra! He added that the law allows them to separate the children! Well if there is any law that allows that it should clearly be changed! Thankfully other passengers offered their place and we managed to sit close, but I found this very upsetting and the steward's answer unhelpful. On our way back, at the boarding point families with young children were offered to board with priority, but then they ask us to pay extra to sit close to our children? Is this what EasyJet considers as family care? Or in our society you need to pay for everything! On their website they advertise their service where by paying you can sit close to the people you care most, and the motto is""easyjet generation"".

We had an effortless journey from London Southend to Malta - the plane was clean and the seats comfortable enough for short journey. However it was the staff that made the difference, my partner left some duty-free a gift for his nephew in the terminal, he was a bit upset, but the cabin crew co-ordinating with the excellent and helpful Stobart Aviation ground staff managed to track it down in albeit a small terminal and retrieve it for him. This felt above and beyond and certainly more than I would have expected from an LCC. Both flights were uneventful, and we landed early on both occasions including a full 45 minute ahead of schedule on the return journey. If I was to be really picky, I would say the boarding experience could be better planned from Southend as it means standing in a cold although sheltered caged area for sometime before being allowed on to the plane and then having to go out in the open as there are no air-bridges at Southend Airport.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Simply put this was the worst service I have ever encountered when flying. When waiting to go home (in the hot sun with a 3 year old) we had to wait in excess of 3 hours while the airport authorities tried to get 37 volunteers not to fly. No reason, no explanation was given. Chaos ensued. No representative from the airline was present, instead, the airline left the announcement and the dealing with how to sort out frustrated, tired, ill, and angry passengers. The airport staff were poorly behaved, rude, threatening both physically and with the police. Apparently, after boarding (eventually) we were told that a member of the crew had fallen ill. This, according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. Problems occur, yes. But the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. Compensation was offered for volunteers. But, no guarantee of a flight back within a week was given. So compensation meant nothing. Those who did choose compensation had real difficulties getting back to their connecting airports. The compensation did not cover, car parking, food, hotel accommodation etc., loss of earnings, connecting flights. easyJet simply did not handle this very well. It appears this is frequent occurrence. The airport staff told us too! I shall not fly with easyJet again. Simply put, they did not care about their customers. Proof - no apology, no announcements, and they did not have one of their staff step off the plane to come and explain. This would have helped a lot. No food or drinks on the return flight too!

Our last experience with Easyjet has been appalling. We got our tickets a month ago but when trying to check in the night before the flight, it turned out that there are no seats left on the plane for us! We arrived super early on the day and were told that easyjet oversells the seats and that we were 'standby passangers'. We had to wait for everyone to board and for the crew to check if anyone did not arrive, leaving empty seats (empty, but paid for!). Stressing over not getting there for a close relative's birthday, the money lost that we paid for the hotel, wasted holiday day booked off work are just the beginning of it. People must know that when they think they are getting seats on the plane, they are only really getting a possibility of a seat. We were absolutely appalled with the fact that the company got paid twice for our seats (my wife sat in the place of someone who did not travel due to serious sickness discovered very recently, as his friends told her and both her and the friends of that person were disgusted that easyjet would not accept refunds but will happily pass that seat to someone else who paid the same money and should have their own seat). We don't understand why getting the ticket and seat is not treated a contract, but instead easyjet 'has the right' to cancel it last minute and tell you that you are not going on the plane for which you bought the ticket, not due to weather or technical problems but as a result of their greed. What a terrible example of customer service!

Weexperienced an overnight delay which resulted in a cancellation due to lightning strike, a new aircraft was flown from Italy to fly us back to Luton. There was one ground staff dealing with departures and arrivals at Munich airport, so as you can imagine, passengers had no idea what was going on and when we would be flying, or where we would be staying over night. The second flight was delayed by a further 5 hours 44 minutes due to technical issues (confirmed in an email). According to the EU Regulation 261/2004, we were entitled to €250 per passenger due to the delay being over three hours. It took over 4 compensation claim forms for easyJet to even respond, even then saying that we were eligible for compensation and that the money would be in our account within 15 days, it wasn’t. Phoned easyJet to get an update and see what was happening. We were then told that the second flight was delayed further due to the lightning strike. Having been in contact with some passengers on the same flight, many had already received the compensation and so I proceeded to explain this to them. He then apologised and said it was an error, and the money would be in the account within 21 day, it wasn’t. Again phoned customer service to be updated, in which I was told that the second flight was a ‘gifted free transfer’, and so compensation could not be claimed. I proceeded to explain that we had been told twice previous that we would receive the compensation. I was told this was by error and that we would not be receiving anything. I then phoned back to finally resolve the issue, and having spoken to her line manager, out of courtesy we would be transferred the compensation.

Both at Liverpool and Palma boarding was organised efficiently and promptly, with Speedy Boarders first on and off the transfer buses. Cabin crews worked hard and the pilots kept us informed of progress. Both flights landed early. Any problems which arose were caused by those passengers who think that rules or requests are for others, not themselves, and in the process make things more difficult for both staff and their fellow passengers. We had the usual suspects ignoring the repeated advice not to put small items in the overhead lockers, so that cabin crews then spent time tactfully trying to rearrange items to allow more trundle bags to be accommodated. On the outward journey a group wearing the kit of ""UK cycle team"" were talking so loudly during the safety briefing that one of the stewardesses actually shouted ""Please pay attention"". On the return journey one of the first passengers to board at the rear of the plane then proceeded to put her bag down in the aisle to open it and take out various items, completely oblivious of the queue held up behind her. I wouldn't mind betting that such people would be the first to complain about poor service or inconsiderate staff.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I queued up to speak to someone about what to do and she took a few minutes to decide but after seeing my case wouldn't fit in the example box she said not to worry, that it was ok and charged me £5 instead of £47. There were a family who were infront of us who were 70 kilos over or weighed 70 kilos so had to cough up £70 there and then, so it was like they were picking and choosing who they would charge and what. Anyway, I was so relieved and happy, got on the plane all the cabin staff were really polite, helpful, friendly and the flight was fine. However on the way home, we arrived at the airport 2 hours early, all checked in online before hand too, we went to the gate on time to get ready to board but there was a huge queue so we walked 1 minute down the airport to a loo quickly. When we got back we were at the front of the queue and there were 2 girls who were meant to check our boarding passes/ID and before even saying hello or waiting for the person infront of me to walk onwards one of the girls shouted 'can you check that case, that looks massive' then looked up and me and said 'that's going to be £47, not even a hello or a please'. I obviously said how it was okay on the way and how I'd used it before with easyJet and Jet2 and she actually said 'well you havent' and I said well I have! Was ridiculous! Then they tried to tell us we were late, when we'd been waiting for 2 hours, so rude. Anyway after looking me and my friend up and down in a judgemental rude way I told them how I don't have the money and that I think it's ridiculous I could fly with it as hand luggage for £5 on the way and now they're wanting £47! At this point everyone had boarded the plane and we were told we were about to miss it, I had to make a quick call to my gran to borrow the money as the hotel we stayed in had taken a huge deposit too and I wasn't getting that back until a few days after we left, and after typing the card details wrong 4 times into her computer the rude girl finally charged me £47 and we had to sprint to the plane. They were so rude and didn't even say hello, please or thank you at any point and set completely different rules as we had on the way. So annoyed and appalled at the rude and unfair staff. After all that the flight back was fine, just dissapointed really. Airport experience with easy jet there was 10/10, easyJet airport experience return 0/10.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

All our flights were delayed to some technical difficulties. If you plan checking in a bag the fees on Iberia and BA are cheaper. easyJet check customers carry on to make sure it fits in the measuring box, if it doesn't be ready to pay a fee. At boarding there were no boarding groups so everyone just lines up. They don't use a jet bridge. The planes were all fairly new A321, 320 which were fine I suppose you really feel the pinch when sitting down and realizing the seat is tiny. On the flight you have a choice to buy the usual drinks and food.

But the Easyjet employee at the check-in desk just printed my boarding pass wrong (only had half the barcode on it), I couldn't get through the entry gate. Therefore, I was sent back and forth between the entry gate and the check-in desk. That wrong boarding pass thing wasted me a lot of time. So not surprisingly, I missed my flight. When I spoke to one of their employees try to get my flight re-scheduled, he told me that my boarding pass was re-printed at 6:13, the gate closure was at 6:40, SO I should have made the flight. Well, I was wondering how he thought 27 mins would be enough for me to get through all the people lined up there at the security check, Not to mention that I could have plenty of time if they just didn't print my boarding pass wrong! Also he told I have to pay extra 80 pounds for a tomorrow's flight! That's outrageous, I haven't yet even asked them to refund my waste of time and my ruined trip.

But once we were airborne, the inflight service was another story: Once they started the food and beverage service, cabin crew constantly had to go back and forth to the galley to get foods or drinks. It took them ages to give passengers what they requested, process payments and reach the next row. They also seemed not to bother about this. I was very annoyed as I just wanted a bottle of water and had to wait for more than 45 minutes until they finally reached my row. This is usually faster with their main competitor. Also, I find it outrageous that Easyjet uses an ""old"" GBP/EUR exchange rate. GBP 1.80 is definitely not 2.50 EUR at the moment! I think Easyjet crews are usually very professional but they should be overall more dynamic.

My experience onboard two flights were pleasant, the cabin crews were nice and the interior of the aircraft is not bad at all for a budget airline. Sadly, the good experience on board was ruined by the horrible ground staff on both flights! On the first flight from AMS to LIN, each of us brought 1 cabin luggage & 1 small bag. We didn't realise that it was a mistake, so when we knew it from the surprisingly unfriendly Dutch ground staffs, we hurriedly packed each of our small bags to the bigger bag. So, we can say that we really tried to respect the rule. However, we felt that as an tourist group, as some passengers could bring 2 Luggage without being warned, maybe it was more because we were a big group of tourists so they wanted to show their power to us. On the second flight, we tried our best to respect the rule by only bringing 1 cabin bag for each of us. And we were positive that it wouldn't lead us to any problem. We were wrong! The ground staff in FCO Airport were trying to charge us 60 euros in the gate just because one of our luggage was a bit too big just because of its wheels!

The main problem is that now after a two hour wait we have a further couple of hours to wait as the current crew has said they are finishing their shifts. We now have to wait for the new crew, who still have to travel to the airport. Unprofessional and no compensation! Sorry does not fix things!

They charged me $129 to change, and then charged me $248 for the same flight the day before (A few minutes after I made this change I looked up how much those same flights cost, and they were selling for $68 - meaning easyjet gouged me). In short, a $68 ticket ended up being around $400. If you are going to fly easyjet and you need to cancel, then dont cancel, just let the seats fly empty and buy your new seats.

Everybody was standing in a big queue. Our flight should have been at 6:55 pm. At 6:45 pm we were still waiting for the flight. And suddenly a few minutes later one person came and said to everybody in the queue that he was very sorry, but our flight has been cancelled. He did not explained to us why that flight was cancelled. Everybody was very disappointed and angry. When we asked him what we can do now he said that if we want to know more information we should go and ask about some details at EasyJet information desk. Again a few minutes later we were in a big queue at the information point and again we were very disappointed. Everything what we heard there was that they have got only 2 flights to Majorca during a week (Tuesday and Friday) and all they can offer us is a leaflet with the information how to apply for refund. They also did not tell us a reason why this flight was cancelled. I was travelling for 5 hours to the airport and after that cancellation again I had to be on my way to home for 5 next hours. It was ridiculous for all passengers. I had to cancel all our holiday because of that cancelled flight and due to that cancellation I will not get all my money from the travel agency.

Nobody at Olbia had informed as to anything more than they were working on the toilets on the plane. The crew visited the airport toilets walking through the departure lounge, they then went back to the plane and ascended the skies without us. This is after the captain had told us personally that he would keep us updated. Nearly 300 people wandered around the terminal at 11.30 pm looking lost and confused. I could see what was coming so I rang a hotel and booked a room. When I went outside the terminal there were no taxis due to there being no flights due until the morning. I tried phoning but were told ""No taxis""! Then one taxi appeared and took us to the hotel. Easyjet posted on their website that we could have a free flight a week later at the same time, or have a refund. We had to fly to Milan the next day to get part way home, then on to Manchester the day after that.

At Berlin Schoenfeld Airport, the queue was extremely long and there were only 3 counters opened. Check-in staff were rude and unhelpful. I feel that the airline's main aim is to be voted ""most on time carrier"" at the expense of passengers. The app does not really work when you have more than 2 boarding passes. For example, I could see that I had 4 boarding passes on the app but I could only open 2 earlier passes. After the check-in staff also could not open the other 2 boarding passes, he issued us with paper passes, but he issued my son's pass twice and not mine causing further confusion and distress at the security gate. Overall, not happy with easyJet. But a positive point on easyJet in comparison with other budget carriers, they allow a child traveller to have a free check-in of a stroller / car seat. Also, instead of spamming with offers on hotel and car rentals, they could alert travellers on what is likely to happen at any particular airport (eg very slow security) as I am sure that they would have data on the number of passengers who missed flights.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I've waited 10 flights to see if things would improve - they didn't. Once you have checked in for a flight on the App, even if you change your reservation, the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted: confusing. The way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. Then you cannot change it yourself. By the way, you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. I like to check in on the way to the airport once I know I will get my flight. No, you have to check in way before. Once, the check in with the app or via their website didn't work, so I tried to call the customer service helpline: waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldn't do anything. You are now on your way to the gate, it is 1/2 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. Normally no stress, not with easyjet, where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight, so you run to realize it hasn't started boarding. In short, if you have a short connection, forget about your connecting flight. You think you are better off with a more expensive Flexi fare ticket (that is what we travel with). Good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security, but in Paris at easyJet terminal there are no fast security lanes, while in Gatwick all the lanes are decently fast. But then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream: you are entitled to board first, but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all, standing in the jetway until you can board the plane. The flight in itself is more or less OK, the staff are usually smiling, except when they bother you, at the first and emergency exit rows, to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders. This time they bothered me saying that I needed to fold my iPad cover during the descent, in a way that I wasn't able to use the Bluetooth keyboard which is part of that iPad cover.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Flight was delayed by over an hour - it would seem this was the case for all EasyJet flights across the day. We had tried repeatedly to pay for extra legroom seats in advance but the airline's website simply refused to load on either of our phones, instead refreshing the login page over and over again. Tried to purchase seats at check-in but we were told the flight was already full and this would not be possible. Boarding was announced a good 45 minutes before we took off but this being EasyJet, it took all of that time to get people moving onto the plane. The usual stress of a lengthy queue going nowhere, ground staff coming through to check every bag they could get their orange labels on into the hold, etc etc. Our seats were beyond uncomfortable - my partner is 6'7"" and was pretty much paralysed in place for the entire flight. This is the last time we will use this airline - it may be marginally cheaper than others but the stress and hassle caused from start to finish simply isn't worth the 'savings'. Also unhappy that we could only pay for the flight online in euros, which of course meant we were charged a fee.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I have trusted their services for years to meet my travel needs. Yesterday my flight was delayed and not only that but when we had landed it took 20 minutes to get off as they only opened one door on the plane to allow passengers to evacuate the plane even though passengers were able to board from both doors which I did not understand. I needed to use the restroom while we were waiting to get off, although because the toilets were out of service I was unable to use them which meant I had to wait 20 minutes to use the restroom. This was not good for me at all as I have dysfunctional kidneys and makes it very painful for me to wait. My flight going to London and coming back to Belfast were both delayed.

I bought the speedy-boarding option. When I arrived at the boarding line, the pre-boarding was already started. So I've been asked to put a label over my luggage to put it in the hold. Apparently the number of available spaces were ended. I just would like to know why they don't simply count. They know how many speedy boarding there are. They know if they've done the check-in and if they are inside the airport. I've seen with my eyes their staff counting with paper and pen how many luggages there are. So, the question is: is it so difficult to reserve the spaces for the speedy boarding customers? They even claim that you can get an additional luggage with you and you can skip the queue. But not if you arrive a few minutes after the started pre-boarding. When they offer to buy the speedy boarding you should tell that some advantages are valid only for a few minutes. On the flight there were free spaces for luggage and a lot of them were used for something that, based on their policy, should stay under the seat. To conclude: if you just wanna go from point A to B, it can be ok easyJet. If you're expecting to pay to have a bit better service, avoid easyJet. They just don't understand how these stupid things can ruin your mood.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_5594-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_5594-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_5594-500x500.jpg","","Type Of Traveller

Our experience with Easyjet was horrendous. Our flight was cancelled at the last minute, and we were notified at the boarding gate after our initial departure time. We were initially told that all flights to Madrid Barajas were being cancelled due to bad weather conditions, however a quick Google search confirmed that this was not true and that ours was the only cancelled flight to Madrid that day. We were escorted out of the airport to a poorly organised customer service area where we were promised by the customer service staff members that we would be refunded for our flights and reimbursed for our new flights to Madrid, transportation costs, accommodation and even food expenditure. We were told that we could not book another flight to Madrid with Easyjet until Monday the 10th (in over 3 days) as their flights were fully booked until then. This was not true, as they were still offering flights for that weekend on their website. However, we couldn’t do anything about it as their ‘support’ staff were unresponsive and dismissive, so we went back home to central London, and tried to look up affordable alternatives that would get us to Madrid in time for the music festival we had paid a lot of money to attend, and to the Airbnb that we had already paid for as well. The cheapest tickets we could find were £200 stand-by tickets (each) with Iberia, on top of the £80 each we had already paid for the Easyjet flight. After leaving Madrid, we were informed by Easyjet that they were actually not going to be refunding us the cost of the flights as their flight was cancelled due to bad weather, and they added that they could not refund our Gatwick express tickets as we sent them a copy of the bank receipt of the tickets with corresponding photos of the tickets, rather than an itemised receipt that we were not given from the station clerk. Overall, because the cancelled Easyjet flight, we had to spend: £280 per person for the flights, £35 each for the Gatwick Express, a wasted £60 on pre-booked accommodation in Madrid, and a lot of stress. That is over £1000 wasted between three people for a short-haul trip. Easyjet has refunded us nothing in return, thus we will never be returning to use their services.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as I can. Firstly, I found the website easy to use and clear and follow-up emails were constructive and informative. I found the Easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. Check-in as operated in Toulouse was efficient and the staff well-presented and polite. While checking in I was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. Toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from Lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. The flight to London was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. I witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. I assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. During the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and I saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. The safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. Snacks were available for purchase. The crew failed to deal with an irresponsible parent who allowed her child to run up and down the aisle during the flight. Disembarkation was orderly.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Two flights on easyJet were delayed, one had the worst turbulence I've experienced and we had to circle before landing, their policy on carry on bags is absurd. Every other airline if you carry a bag and a backpack you're fine but you can volunteer to check for free, but with easyJet you have to either stuff them into one or pay $60 in order to check the bag. Additionally, twice the gate was moved after waiting at the gate it was originally assigned, which could be an airport issue but since it happened at two different airports it is suspicious.

This was my worst experience flying. It all started when I was on my way to to the airport when I received message that plane would be 40 minutes delay and while at the airport another when it said 2 hours and 15 minutes, that was bad but OK. Plane departed 2 hours later than scheduled, but that's when fun begin, Captain told us that we might not be able to land in Berlin because airport is closing at midnight and we might not get exception which was the case so we were diverted to Rostok. We were told that buses will be waiting for us when we exit the terminal and message from EasyJet said that cabin crew will be there to assist us and will give us some food and drinks. Reality was a bit different, when we got out, there was one bus which was close and driver nowhere to be seen (we were one of the 3 aircraft) and cabin crew got into their shuttles and left, I've stopped one from other aircraft (from my already left) and she told me to ask person at the airport, there was no person at the airport. It took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. I could understand that things like diverting can happen, but the way EasyJet handled that is beyond terrible, I thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this. I used to fly with EasyJet often and it was my favourite budget airline, but I'm done with them and I won't be flying with them again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

When it came to boarding they made everyone sit and re-pack their bags to fit it all in 1 case - wasn't even allowed to wear my bum bag which was for my essentials (passports, money, etc). We still had plenty of room in our checked luggage but the lady on the check in desk intentionally sent off our bags then told us about the bag situation, poor customer service. If this was the case atleast notify your customer prior to sending off their checked baggage and we would have packed the backpack in their. Flight was delayed by an hour atleast get your flights on time then tell people about the bags. These guys can't get anything right!

We boarded flight to Lille having been told we would need to make our own way to Paris by train. But once on plane, we were told we would be catching a shuttle bus to Paris that would take 2 hours. The bus driver told us the trip would take at least 3 hours, not 2 hours. On arrival at Paris airport, the bus driver did not know how to enter the airport. Hence, time spent parked in middle of road whilst he made phone calls to find out info. I repeat the 2.5 hour trip took 7 hours and 50 minutes. We were not provided with any food or drink whatsoever during this prolonged trip. No apologies were made. The little bit of information we receive was incorrect.

A few days before, I was told by email that the flight would be operated by SmartLynx airline. Having never heard of them, I made a few enquiries and found out that they were an Eastern European setup. I had booked exit row seats and already printed off my boarding pass so hoped the seats were configured the same. They were and a charming flight attendant let me know the rules attached to the exit row seat. The aircraft looked a bit stark - white all over and no logos. Interior was grey leather seating which was actually much more comfortable than the Easyjet modern seats and the crew were smart and very pleasant. The captain had good communication skills and kept us informed about our route. The flight was smooth and only a few minutes delayed.Overall, I would recommend the product and Easyjet have chosen well in choosing this airline to operate in their name.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

To be fair, the trip to Paris was ok, but the flight back was terrible, with not one, but a series of unpleasant occurrences. The problematic flight from Paris to London Luton was due to set off at 9:55pm, but was delayed by an hour and took off at 10:55pm Paris time. Despite the delay, the boarding procedures were extremely inefficient. There was no sense of urgency despite the tardiness, especially given the fact that this is such a late flight. The gate number also changed mid-way through the delayed hour. When we scanned the boarding pass, my friend was stopped by one of the staff as he was carrying two backpacks. Despite the fact some people's roller cabin luggage alone is the size of my friend's two backpacks combined, that staff insisted that my friend must pack everything into one backpack only. My friend had to step out, repack everything into one bulging, overflowing backpack before he is let through. The content brought through the gate doesn't change, the two backpacks were far from exceeding the luggage allowance in the first place, and the staff has created nothing more than sheer annoyance and further delay in our already delayed trip. The flight was around 50 minutes long and given the 1-hr time difference, reached London Luton airport at around 10:45pm London time. By this time, my friend and I were very anxious as we need to catch the 11:20pm bus from the airport to the train station, if we miss that bus, we will miss the last train home and will inevitably have to spend the night out in the streets. Just when everyone is getting their luggage from the cabin and gearing to leave, a flight announcement sounded saying that the bus to the gate will not be here for another ten minutes, and we were frustrated. Despite being late for an hour, the shuttle bus to the gate is still not scheduled on time! By the time the shuttle bus came, everyone got in, and we arrived at the gate, it was 11pm and we have barely 20 minutes to run to the customs, clear it, and dash to the bus stop. I have to run and dash through the crowd like a mad person, and we hopped onto the bus with only 2 minutes to spare. I don't think I will take easyjet again. What an ironic name.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

In my experience customer service is quite terrible and sadly the only thing I remember. I normally have a jacket with me for cold air temperatures inflight. I have never been told that my backpack can't fit under the seat (because it can and it does fit) in front of me and I need to put it overhead or that I need to put my jacket on or overhead for takeoff and landings until this flight. And I am a frequent flyer. This nitpicking, which coincidentally was only for me, felt ridiculous. With all the add-ons (eg. 18 euros per kg overweight check-in baggage) it's not even good value.

Charged 47 euro at gate for my wheeled bag because I was not allowed to add a hold bag online after online check in. Many passengers subsequently boarded with wheeled bags much bigger than mine, I asked them if they were charged and they all said no. Flight was 2 hours late owing to technical problem. Got more information from flight tracker than easyJet. Tried to call easyJet from Madrid and gave up after holding for nearly 20 minutes. Used chat message facility but this kept failing and eventually got poor response online. Speedy boarding did not work as other passengers simply unhooked the chain separator on the bus to board at the same time. Despite long delay on inbound flight, there was no bridge available at both ends caused and this added to delay. Overall a huge disappointment - I have used this airline many times before but would choose alternative in future.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The Captain had provided a detailed update on what was happening and actually came into the cabin to speak directly to everyone over a short delay to take off due to flight congestion in Marrakech. After two hours into the flight, the Captain announced that a member of the flight attendant crew had been taken ill and he had decided to divert to Lisbon to get her medical treatment. Immediately the remaining crew took steps to get the plane ready for a landing and the Captain continued to supply information on what was happening and how problems on finding a replacement crew member were handled. It was handled efficiently that everyone was fully informed and understanding of the problems. After landing the crew member was taken away by ambulance and within 30 minutes a replacement arrived. Whilst we waited the Captain kept us informed and walked through the plane to answer anyone who had specific questions. The flight continued on to Marrakech arriving two hours late.

Having travelled extensively for over 50 years, never have I experienced such appalling, intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. From the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight. Whilst I understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with (as do all other customer facing roles) the majority of yesterday's passengers appeared to be middle aged, sensibly behaved golfers & regular, well mannered holiday makers. We were all initially warned that the crew had a ""list of passenger names"" who'd made purchases from Manchester airport duty-free and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found 'guilty' they would have the duty-free confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. An example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to Tenerife, and was conveyed as if this was a threat. One does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. As far as I could see, most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. The in-flight safety demonstration then commenced, but the steward paused it, and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be ""returning to the terminal and we'd be going nowhere"". Much as I fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples (there were many others) there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. I did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. I witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger (behind his back) as ""grandad"". Another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger, there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. When the cabin steward announced that in flight duty-free sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in Turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight (hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in Turkey). We subsequently did not purchase anything from duty-free in protest to such slanderous remarks, nor did fellow passengers nearby. It was a relief to disembark, in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. I have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before, however on this occasion I feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay. I enjoy flying as a rule and have never come away from a journey feeling nervous of the crew. I sincerely hope we don't encounter this particular crew ever again. I will also think hard about which airline I choose to put my business through.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I usually had no issues with EasyJet, as a single person you can deal with no thrill on short flights. However, now as a parent my needs and requirements have changed and i do not think Easyjet takes care of this customer base at all. On a bright side - staff was nice and at points very helpful. However my stroller was not delivered to the aircraft at my destination - not an airport restriction as even Ryanair does this - I had to wait for my stroller more than people for their luggage (not easy with active toddler) - on the way back in Gatwick again I did not get the stroller and when I asked if it will be at the top of the sleeve was told it will not be available until baggage claim. That is a very long walk carring a toddler and waiting for passport control. I was told that 'maybe' i can find a yellow pushchair that i guess are used to lower the cost of service. None was available to anyone on this flight - not only me. If easyJet wants to use this system than i should have an option to prebook this chair or have enough available for all. Otherwise they cant claim they provide the service. - at the end again I had to wait until most of the luggage rolled off I fly a lot with my toddler - low cost and not - but never before I have had to endure this inconvenience. It may not be a problem with older kids but with toddler it really makes a 2 hour already challenging journey terrible.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We were informed that the flight was full, and l must praise the cabin crew for the courteous, friendly and helpful way in which they managed the boarding process and accommodated everybody's luggage into the overhead bins. The aircraft was clean and tidy. We were told by the Captain that there would be a 30 minute delay leaving Palma due to aircraft congestion in the London area (the communication from the flight deck crew was accurate and informative). A reasonably priced Buy On Board food and beverages service was offered twice during this 2 hour flight. The only disappointing aspect to the journey was when we arrived at a remote stand at London Gatwick. Although the bus was ready and waiting to transfer the passengers to the North Terminal, it took nearly 25 minutes for ground service personnel to arrive and position the stairs against the side of the aircraft. Again we were kept well informed by the Captain and this inconvenience could not be attributed to the airline but their assigned ground handling agent.","Unverified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Ground staff were terrible a few years ago but now they have become very professional, they don't rush you as much as they used to. They are there to help. I flew to the Canary Islands on a 4 hour flight and it was very comfortable. I was on a recently refurbished aircraft and the slim seats prove to be more comfortable than they look. The crew are very helpful, of course they try to sell a lot but they do it in a friendly way. Food and Drink is affordable, especially if you get a meal deal, but some of the products are extremely over priced. The magazine is basically sell sell sell!

The cleanliness and comfort of the plane was acceptable as was the service from the flight crew and communication from the pilots. What lets the airline down is generally the pre-flight experience: - insufficient bag drops open, prolonged queues for boarding gates, lack of seating in boarding gate areas – all gives the feeling that Easyjet don't care about the convenience and comfort of their customers. Oh and if you are going to encourage passengers to bring only cabin luggage then redesign your planes to cope with this, because you can't get your holiday off to a better start than by having to stand on the runway/steps in the cold, wind or rain whilst the people at the front of the queue are rearranging their baggage in the overhead lockers and blocking the aisles.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

On December 23rd I flew back from Gatwick to Edinburgh, the plane due to take us was held up in Belfast by a storm. When it finally came (I was supposed to catch the 7pm plane) it was given to the passengers waiting from the delayed 5pm plane. To cut the story short the plane we finally got put on (and then sat waiting) finally reached Edinburgh after 1 am on morning of 24th Dec. This is because easyJet now juggle with planes and have too few to cover the short falls. Last night my Edinburgh plane was again delayed to Gatwick, should have been 6.55 pm and it finally got in at 9pm. One other winge is that they frequently fly you in the plane that differs from the diagram of one used to allocate tickets, twice now I have booked £10 extra for sitting in row with extra leg room over wings (Exit) and ended up in one with virtually no leg room as its a different plane. No one explains this and yet they take money paid for space. I shall not be using the flights from Edinburgh any more, they used to be a pleasant alternative to the train - used to.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Both flights with Easyjet have been great. Bright, modern aircraft, enthusiastic but not pushy cabin staff. Drinks a bit expensive but I'm in holiday mode so I don't mind. The early departure means an extended first day and the return is again, at a reasonable hour. Plenty of chat from the flight deck and overall a really good experience. I always pay a bit extra for exit row seats as I'm a bit lanky and with this comes Speedy Boarding so there's always room for my luggage in the aircraft. However, I will add that it seems to be a free for all in Arrecife with no discernible advantage to have SB. As I now have a holiday home in Lanzarote, I will be visiting quite often following my retirement so Easyjet will continue to be my airline of choice.","Unverified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I always travel with a hand luggage if my trips aren't longer than a week. Yesterday at the airport in Venezia (Marco Polo) they wouldn't let me pass with my hand luggage although it fits the official proportions of the company/airport, then they made me pay 60 euros for the luggage, an absurd price, I paid more for the luggage than for the flight. I always travel with the same luggage, but thanks to the person in charge from easyjet I had this problem - other passengers pointed out to me that they passed with luggage bigger than mine. So my advice is don't ever pay those 60 euros if you get in the same situation as I did, report it to the airport, do what you need to do, but don't pay that money. 10 people who came after me had to put the luggage on hold, that is to send it for free because the plane was full, so for them they could do that but I had to pay 60 euros.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They told us to monitor the updates on the TV screen. We went to the waiting area but the status of the flight has never changed from ""gate closed"".

We tried This phone for 30 min but no one was answering. When we could get out from the airport security zone, we went to easyJet desk in order to put us on the next flight they asked us to pay £80 each. How can they make us pay for their mistake?

Some simple signage and advice on the app or website (I did check before travelling) would have allowed my taxi to drop me at the right place. Passport control not within EasyJet's control I admit but they should be making representations to the authorities was incredibly slow. Security was fairly quick. Then boarding - I've rarely had a more unpleasant experience. Coming through the gate at the ""last and final urgent call"", I am greeted with the dreaded bus. Already packed of course, and more passengers pile on behind me well after cut-off time. We stood on the bus - cramped, cold, uncomfortable - for over 15 minutes before we were driven to the stand. Boarding once off the bus was quick enough, we taxied on time and were in the air by 0955. Seat was the usual cramped LCC arrangement. No recline at all. Slept, so no idea on service. Landed slightly ahead of schedule and then rather surprisingly got a jetway to the plane, so at least I didn't have the horrors of a bus both ends.

It was the first time I had flown with easyJet since they introduced the non-reclining seats and I found the leg room much better and the seat more comfortable than the old ones. I didn't buy any food or drink onboard but the crew managed to offer two trolley services during the short flight which seemed very efficient. The plane landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule and there was only a very short wait to collect my bag. All in all a very satisfactory experience.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Pilot had 2 failed attempts at landing in Gibraltar due to wind so we diverted to Malaga but after a few minutes diverted to Seville with the excuse it was windy at Malaga too. Landed at Seville and were kept on the plane for over an hour while they worked out what to do. Could not go back to Gibraltar as weather worsened. Eventually bussed back to Gibraltar which took 3 hrs and finally arrived there at 8pm instead of 11.55am. At no point were we offered a drink or food on the plane - unless we paid for it. A goodwill gesture of free food or drink would have made a huge difference. The next day we discovered that both flights after ours had landed in Gibraltar and all flights into Malaga had also landed - why couldn't our pilot? I am aware landing at Gibraltar can be hazardous and have been diverted to Malaga on one occasion a few years ago but the detour we had to endure seemed pointless and totally unnecessary. All I have had from easyjet is a text thanking me for my understanding! We are not impressed with easyjet and their pilot skills or their customer care on this occasion.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We flew on the early flight at 6.35 so didn't expect the cabin crew to be too nice however they were very friendly and willing to help. We didn't try the food and drink on either flight so cannot comment on it. On the way back at Faro the plane had not come in yet so we were all told to go and wait in a room looking over the airport to wait for the arrival of the other plane and everyone to get off. The plane was very clean so well done cabin crew. Not a lot of leg room but that is expected on a budget flight. EasyJet was good for a budget plane, would recommend.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Bag drop only took about 15 mins but unfortunately we weren't told of the 50 minute delay which they must have know about as it was the inbound flight that was delayed so we could have sat outside in the sun for a bit longer. Gate came up as if flight was on time so everyone gathered and We stood there for 50 minutes wondering why we weren't boarding. That's my only complaint. Once on board.

The plane departed on time and the flight was better than I expected. The cabin staff was very friendly and the seats are comfortable enough. The legroom was better than legroom in other low-cost flights. I had to pay for my seat and for the food. But the focaccia I have bought for 3.5€ was hot and very delicious. Juice for 3€ was a bit expensive if you compare it with the good price of the focaccia but it was also good. The small room where I had to wait before Boarding was not comfortable because I did not have a seat for 10 minutes.

We elected to pay with a card which didn't please the female staff member as she didn't have a card reader and with my wifes card on display for all to see she wrote out a receipt giving every passenger in close proximity a clear view of the numbers. When my wife objected to this it was made clear to her that this was frowned upon and we could be banned from the flight. For our return on 1st November the staff in Berlin were totally different and my own bag was put in the hold free of charge to free up cabin space.

When my partner and I previously flew easyJet, we were crammed into tiny seats with no legroom at all, and were told we would have to pay extra to be moved up front (even though the seats were empty and the attendant could clearly see my partner, at 6'7"", was clearly far too tall for the regular seats). As a result this time we paid an additional fee for exit row seats, which included 'speedy boarding'. Firstly, there was no speedy boarding. We had the privilege of showing our tickets at the gate ahead of other passengers, only to be kept waiting in the corridor for about 20 minutes before everyone was allowed to swarm towards the plane. We were then shocked to find our so-called 'exit row' seats were almost exactly the same as regular seats, with maybe an extra inch of legroom. I shudder to think what would happen in an actual emergency, as there would certainly be very little room for passengers to swiftly evacuate the plane this way. We endured almost as much discomfort as on previous flights, and could not believe we had been made to pay for such a joke. And as with every easyJet flight, I find it ridiculous that we have to pay for hold luggage, when on every flight I have ever taken with them somebody at the gate has announced that the plane is 'too full' for everyone's cabin baggage and invited people to check theirs in. An utter rip-off. Will not be flying with them again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Because we were forced to check at the gate they charged an extra fee, so the $80 to check the bag was almost more than the cost of the ticket. What a racket. What's worse, when I contacted them to complain they simply replied (after weeks of waiting and multiple contact attempts) that this was standard policy. The flight itself made us feel like we were living in an infomercial with the flight attendants selling all kinds of junk up and down the aisles.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

If it was once or twice I would be happy to say 'that's life' but I think this last flight was the straw that broke the camel's back. The cabin service was appalling as the crew spent more time in the galley than looking after their customers. It is only a 2.5 hour flight from Faro and they eventually came to us nearly two hours into the flight only again to say there was no hot food left. All I want to know is, is this a company policy to carry limited supplies, which surely is false advertising, or is it just ineptitude by ground services? I don't expect 'a golden service' but I do expect to able to except what is advertised on offer.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The man in front of us was an Easyjet cabin crew trainer who was going to take this up when we got home so he would have confirmed what had happened. We have complained many times asking for a refund of our speedy boarding fee but have been told that they will use this as feedback and never reimburse this fee. Is this not taking money under false pretences if there's no speedy boarding on the return flight? Have since been back to Sofia and used Wizzair, speedy boarding both ways brilliant!

It's cheap, they fly to Gatwick, planes are new and crew professional and friendly. The flights are almost always late, due to ground handling issues. Twice this week, I have been delayed (1 hour tonight, 2.5 hours Monday) due to the water not being cleared and replaced on the aircraft when it should. On Monday this resulted in me getting to my apartment 3 hours late at 1am. Tonight this resulted in passengers flushing the toilets manually using bottles of mineral water provided by the crew and using a hand sanitiser to ""wash"" hands. For the second time this week, there was also no hot or cold food. Tonight, not for the first time, we were then dropped at the South Terminal at Gatwick rather than the North as scheduled, leaving people to find their way to their cars, taxis or friends at the other terminal. I have now reached the point where if I have a choice of airline on a route, I will choose another than EasyJet, even if it costs substantially more. I used to be a fan of EasyJet, but having become a regular flyer with them over the last year, I can no longer recommend them.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I prefer the relative comfort of easyJet's A319 seats compared to Ryanair's 737-800 seats. Seat pitch on the A319 was more than adequate for me (1m 78cm) for a 2.5 hour trip.

The flight started off as being delayed for a couple of hours which we didn't think much of, then eventually ended up being canceled for a completely unrelated issue. I stress unrelated as they don't have to pay out compensation if it is for a particular reason to do with air traffic control, with conveniently it was. Regardless of wether we are entitled to compensation or not we are entitled to a refund of our flight ticket although they still don't seem to want to even pay that out. Five emails back and forth and getting board of hearing how sorry they are for the inconvenience. Definitely would not recommend this airline, I wouldn't have expected much from them by their price but now just feel conned from them.

Huge mistake. I've never had a worse flight experience. The flight (Barcelona to Basel) was an hour late leaving the gate because of some technical breakdown. Once we started taxiing it took more than 30 min to get off the ground. Not clear why the taxi took so long but we could have driven around the entire airport several times in that time. They have luggage requirements different from all other airlines. They appear to make all of their money running this luggage con. You can only have a single piece of luggage. They don't tell you during the long wait in line either. They purposely wait until you are just about to board so you don't have time to re-arrange your luggage. If you do manage to consolidate your luggage, they are waiting and ready to throw the other shoe at you: oh that luggage is too bulky and/or heavy. They charge you 60€ to check an extra bag. It is that or miss your flight. They are not even polite about it. 6 of us got caught in exactly the same way on this flight. After that, the ticket price is no longer competitive. Adding insult to injury, the luggage bins in the cabin are huge and could easily fit luggage much larger than ours and we flew with them all half empty. Nothing free is offered in flight to eat or drink. What they do sell is grossly over priced. The last straw was at the arrival, walking up and down stairs with droves of other people down long tunnels. Additionally, they took forever to send the luggage to the belt at destination basically guaranteeing we would miss our train at the destination. We are dreading the return flight which will be tomorrow. Never again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Flight eventually left at 1am next morning, so should be home shortly. Apparently previous crew had run out of flying hours so a replacement crew had to be drafted in to get us home. The plane starts to descend to land at Gatwick, wheels down and then a steep pull up, full power and we are back up, pilot then tells us that as we are so late the main runway is closed for repairs so he attempted to land on second runway but due to bad lighting and visibility he aborted landing. He was then going to circle for 15 mins while they re-opened the main runway. Next announcement was ""welcome to Stansted"". We were then told to wait on the plane while they sorted coaches for onward travel. 20 mins later were we told to make our way to arrivals for the transport home but once we were in arrivals we were then told to make our own way home (2am in the morning) and seek compensation on the EasyJet website. We eventually arrived back in Gatwick at 9am, another day off work. So far, now 22nd August, despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation, no refund of our bus fares, no explanation. EasyJet Customer Service is anything but a customer service. They have employed every tactic to not give us a straight answer. When everything is ok, they give a good service, when it goes wrong, lookout. In reality we could have flown 1st class on BA for what it has actually cost us for these ""cheap"" seats.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They are not kidding when they sell themselves as a budget airline. If you are aware of this fact, and what it entails, then you know they will get you to where you are going, quickly and fairly efficiently, but that comfort and convenience are not high on the agenda. Their ground facilities will be using the worst and most out-of-they way parts of the airport they are flying to and from (in my case Terminal H from Schiphol, which is the least pleasant part of the airport, despite being relatively new, and London Stansted, of which many more passengers than I have already fittingly described on this site). Any extra service above getting you and only you to your destination will have to be paid for. However, the aircraft themselves seem clean enough, and for short haul flights are adequate.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

They don't clean the plane between flights and this keeps the times punctual.

After the flight delay, which exceeded 3 hours, on leaving Malaga we were subsequently unable to land at Gatwick because the weather had deteriorated. No reasonable explanation was given for the delay. Regarding the issues with our flight it was almost unbelievable that we were left stranded at Liverpool airport with no arrangements made for our onward travel to Gatwick. Even more outrageous was the fact that the airline was continuing to charge passengers for food and drink on board while we were being held for hours on the tarmac before disembarking at Liverpool. We have never experienced an organisation that appears to reagrd its customers with such contempt. We won't be using easyJet ever again and would advise others not to use them unless they are willing to accept this kind of service.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We used EasyJet to book airfare from Paris-Barcelona-Paris and a week later for Paris-Napes-Paris. Trip to Barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal, onto busses, then to a plane on tarmac - similar debark in Barcelona. Inconvenient, slow. On the return trip, an EasyJet staffer pulled us out of line, measured our bags. One bag was 1"" too long. She said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. We were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. Later looking online, it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bag/purse per passenger is general, but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carry-on bag is allowed. Very confusing. I can embrace the concept of a low-cost carrier but be clear about what you're not offering. Not even water, soda, juice or crackers was provided. Seats do not recline. Friendly helpful service was non-existent. Staff at BCN to help with complaints did not exist either. Worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight - we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. Had I not happen to wake up and check my phone at 3:30am, we would have been totally screwed. As it was, I spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 one-way tickets to Naples. EasyJet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. The return flight was an Air France flight. That wasn't cancelled. So, now I needed one-way tickets (expensive) and last minute (even more expensive). What did EasyJet offer in compensation? They would rebook me (at no charge) another flight to Naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. Two issues. Next available EasyJet flight was 5 days later (bye-bye vacation). Value as for 1/2 round fair purchased a month ago. I will never fly EasyJet again. Wish I could rate lower than a 1. For the last kick in the pants, EasyJet also booked my rental car. Though I was clearly booking a 7 day trip to Naples, they only reserved the rental car for 1 day.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall I found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. In normal circumstances I could endure this for a short three hour flight, however, a fate would have it the seat in front wouldn't stay in an upright position - it was in a permanent reclining position - it was broken. I asked the Stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do, which was reasonable. She seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so I sat with the Lady in front practically sitting on my lap. After a couple of hours I decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane, and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. So I sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. The Chief Stewardess rudely asked me why I was sitting there so I told her that row 16 seat was broken. She said I would have to pay extra to sit at the front so I asked her if I would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours - she said not and that I would have to return to my broken seat. As a matter of principle I refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to Row 16. On my return home I sent a complaint to Easyjet on 29th May. I received the following response right back ""Dear easyJet Customer Thank you for contacting easyJet via our online form. We aim to reply to you within 3days, although in busy periods this may be longer. We’ll be in touch soon. Regards, easyJet Customer Services"". That was on 29th May 2016 - it is now 3rd August 2016, almost ten weeks later and I haven't heard anything more from Easyjet. Seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesn't surprise me one little bit. I am a reasonable person who realises that things go wrong now and then but the disgraceful attitude of staff onboard and the total ignoring of my post-flight complaint proves to me that Customer Service is very low on the priority list.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Outward leg was delayed slightly but made up the time and landed a little ahead of schedule. Bought a nice cup of coffee and a bottle of water - not too expensive and nice coffee. Had an exit row seat which was just right for my lanky legs I did not mind paying extra for this plus, being allowed to print boarding passes well in advance is nice as you can relax knowing you won't be bumped out of your seat (as happened to me in March with Iberia Express). Return leg five days later was also in an exit row seat with the added extra of Speedy Boarding on both legs a real bonus. The plane seemed newer and if anything, even more generous with legroom. Seat OK for the 3.5 hours flight. Two bar services and a decent red wine made this a pleasurable flight. I have never had a negative experience with Easyjet and will continue to use them so long as the price is right.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

After delays of 2 hours, which is quite good for easyjet, our gate was announced. This was where the drama started. We went to gate 55D which was the same gate the Glasgow flight which had been called earlier. After about half an hour of trying to figure out who was at gate 55D they decided to move the Edinburgh passengers. They moved us to gate 54 which was back through the check in desk. On getting there we were told we could get through. So the 100 or so passengers were trapped in a glass corridor in the blistering heat. After another half an hour they decided to move us in to what looked like a departure lounge that time forgot. Basically seats and that was it. I asked one time during the next half hour if could visit the bathroom and was told no. When an announcement finally came. The first one of the day I hasten to add the the flight was cancelled. We then had to wait about an hour until they decided to escort us out of the airport through passport control, even though we were domestic which took another half hour. After finally getting out of departures we were expected to stand in a queue for cutover services with one person on the desk. I'm pretty sure I would have been there 2 days later which ironically was the next flight they were offering. I know eastJet is cheap but if it wasn't my company that booked the flights I wouldn't fly with easyjet ever again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Yesterday's flight from Edinburgh to Gatwick was delayed by an hour. We then lost time for some unknown reason and arrived even later. When we arrived at Gatwick the pilot couldn't park the plane and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a tug to push the plane into position to enable the jetty to be attached. If I wasn't tired and hungry it would have been comical. Today boarding should have commenced 50 minutes ago, we have been left standing for 50 minutes with absolutely no explanation in the sweltering heat of the departure lounge. So it looks like my return journey will have a similar farcical delay. If you are flying the Edinburgh to Gatwick route, do yourself a favour and use British Airways. You will be surprised how similar the fares are. And for the record, I am not a British Airways employee, I am a disgruntled Easyjet customer. In conclusion, I only have myself to blame for booking a flight with Easyjet, I guess it's time for me to practice what I preach.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

It's the old adage that you get what you pay for. EasyJet is a very cheap way to travel by air. And that's what you have to remember. EasyJet - by the looks of it - is shoved to the furthest part of the airports presumably for cheaper renting space. The staff seem adequately trained but a little distant and indifferent but they do get you through with little fuss. You have to permanently keep reminding yourself when travelling with EasyJet (or any other super low-cost airline) that you're flying at a fraction of the cost of other airlines and that you should always bare that in mind no matter what. There is no airs and graces with them and you'll be expected to shuffle along with the pack with almost no service or attention paid to you.

Not only was this an expensive flight for a short trip in Europe but the attendants at the gate were very rude. The website says that you have to pay 60€ for an extra bag (in a subtle way), so you must know that going into it. Unfortunately, we did not know this policy until we get to the gate and they aggressively asked for our money. After traveling throughout Europe for some time, we have never had any problem with our baggage. Most airlines have allowed one small bag and one overhead bag, so while we still have all of that luggage, we have to pay for what they already have space for on their flight. Furthermore, once we had boarded the flight, we noticed ample space in all of the overhead luggage compartments for the bags while they had specifically said at the gate that due to the full flight, they could not fit our baggage. They charge you for all food and beverages as well. The policies this airline holds are frankly absurd as they try to rip you off. Definitely not worth what you pay for. They advertise themselves as a cheap airlines while instead you will probably have to pay the price of a much nicer flight. However, they do leave on time and their boarding process goes quickly.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I can say that they were fantastic. My partner and I had flown to Edinburgh on business. We booked a return flight for 8pm but we were finished earlier than expected at 1pm. Dreading the long wait for our flight my partner suggested we go to the airport and ask if we could change our flight. I was quite adament that this could not be done unless you paid either over the odds or paid for another seat. We went to the airport and asked the member of staff at the easy jet desk if we could change our flight. She replied of course and had us on the eariler flight leaving at 5.40pm. This was done in the space of 5 minutes and no extra cost at all. We were delayed going out and coming back but not for long and these are things that cannot be helped. I can say they were very professional and accommodating. I will be using them again.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Finally I board to sit next to an overweight undershowered fellow. All we got offered was a glass of tap water.

I've been flying with Easyjet for about 7 years, mostly to the Canaries. Over the years, I could see a great deal of improvement in the service, food and aircraft. To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath. I don't think low-cost could be much better than this.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Outbound a few minutes early, no issues, very acceptable, return flight was 20 minutes late arriving then seemed to take an age on turnaround, then it picked up an air traffic delay at Berlin but they made good progress on the return flight and landed only about 20 minutes late. On checking in at Berlin, it's seems ironic, Easyjet state they like you to arrive 2 hours early at the airport yet we couldn't check-in our bag until 2 hrs 10 mins before our flight. Easyjet also tell passengers that they will more likely get their cabin bags in the overhead locker space if they try to board early, we paid for speedy boarding and were amongst the first passengers on board, safely put our bags (smaller than most) in the overhead lockers, yet a guy boards almost last couldn't get his large case in the lockers so the flight attanedant takes mine out and tells me to put it under the seat in front of me, severely restricting space for my feet for the whole flight. Not impressed. Other than that Easyjet, you did OK and we wouldn't have a problem flying with you again. Easyjet you have to take some responsibility for the airports you use, Berlin Schonfeld is the worst airport I have ever used, see separate review.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

On my way out we were on a new livery with the old cabin. The boarding area at Liverpool was very hot and they kept turning the lights on and off. We used air stairs and had to go down about four flights of stairs before we even get onto the tarmac. We departed about ten minutes late because they hadn't yet refuelled. In the air, you could purchase food or drinks, as well as items from a large duty free selection. It would be a good tip to actually give out napkins when we're served a drink. The seats didn't seem to recline and the windows were messy. The crew could smile a bit more, they seemed bored. We landed about 5 minutes late and had a jetway at Barajas. If I ever require budget air travel in future, I'll most likely choose them.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The flight was smooth and on time, and cabin crew attitude was good though they do not serve you unless you buy something. On this instance practically no one buys anything (a tea bag costs £2.50). Seat pitch is a bit narrow but that doesn't matter. I boarded with a cabin trolley and a computer bag: I was asked that I must be able to put the bag inside the trolley at the gate, which I did after a lot of fuss. Other airlines will allow an extra small bag. The flight was less than half full, and I think this restriction was imposed because EasyJet wants to demonstrate that they are a cheap carrier. But after cost of a checked bag etc it was not that cheap, and you suffer from arriving at SXF rather than the more convenient TXL.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P1150484-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P1150484-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P1150484-500x500.jpg","","Aircraft

On 28 Feb 2016 I was supposed to take a flight from Naples to Paris Orly. Unfortunately this was cancelled due to the weather conditions. Ground staff did all they could to help passengers. We were told to come back the next morning for a new flight scheduled at 9.55. This flight finally departed after 13.00. The reason given by the captain (in Italian and English - translated into French by a stewardess) was that an emergency slide had to be repaired before departure and that he was waiting for the final paperwork. Result was a near 22 hour delay on arrival in Paris. I accept this misfortune could happen with any airline. What I do not accept is that on 15 June I am still waiting for the reimbursement of my out of pocket expenses and that EasyJet have claimed that they do not owe any compensation under European legislation as the flight was delayed due to weather conditions - that was the case for the original flight, but not for the replacement flight. By way of comparison following a mechanical failure on a Flybe flight compensation was finalized within 24 hours. As a result of this experience I have learned to NO longer have any faith in EasyJet and in future shall do all in my power to avoid this airline and to warn potential flyers about their poor after sales service (plenty of bla-bla, but no action).","","","","","","","","Aircraft

He said it was going to be delayed an hour to start but could be delayed as much as four hours before the flight left. So here was a full flight, in an uncomfortable airplane with children and families on board that was going to just sit. What upsets me here is that the crew knew about this potential delay prior to boarding and still put everyone on the plane. The plane did finally leave, 5 hours later.

The price I paid for our flights was low, I decided to book extra legroom seats which made the flight very comfortable and came with automatic Speedy Boarding and an extra bag allowance (I still think Easyjet's policy towards handbags etc. is annoying and unnecessary).

Pleasant cabin crew and good information from the captain about our journey. Coming back the bag drop didn't open until 2 hours before the departure so many people were queuing for some time as they had expected this to be 3 hours. Nevertheless the flight back was also punctual and the same professional attitude from the crew. EasyJet are definitely my preferred short haul carrier.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We flew from Manchester to Santorini and then returned from Athens to Manchester with easyJet. Both flights were on time and pleasant. Aircraft were clean and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. They came through the cabin twice for food and beverage sales, once for duty free, and several times to collect rubbish. Extra legroom seats were an excellent value and include Speedy Boarding and use of the much quicker check-in queue. Seats on our flights did not recline, so there were no problems with rude people reclining too much and trapping people in the row behind them.

Flight departed pretty much on time, only the busy flight traffic at Gatwick holding us up. Landed in Malpensa early so made up any lost time. Flight itself was comfortable enough for a short flight. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly enough. Took our own water on board as know the score in regards food and drink on board. Return flight was same as outbound flight, in fact left bang on time and landed very early. It's worth noting that Terminal 2 at Malpensa is a bit dated but you can see improvements are being made to facilities, this will take time but they'll get there. Facilities were adequate enough and free bus to terminal 1 for train station was easy to find. Used the easyJet app on my phone for check in etc. Impressed as gives you a message when your gate us announced and all that. Works well and easy to use compared to other airline apps. Overall can thoroughly recommend easyJet from this and past experience. My wife was also impressed with her first experience.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Due to problem with plane the easyjet Manchester departure was slightly delayed and some passengers could not fly as the plane that was substituted was smaller. We did get on the flight but all our seats were changed, for a short flight and being older children this was not a huge issue but we had paid for allocated seating and it took several unanswered emails and eventually a long and no doubt costly call to Easyjet to try to claim the payment back. They tried to offer me free seat allocation on the next flight, as I'm hoping never to have to use this airline again I politely refused and was told a refund would be given in 5-10 days - time will tell! Return trip was delayed but no announcement made or info given, when finally boarded in Venice the cabin staff were to say the least brusque, we were seated at very back of flight and of course no room was left for baggage, rather than try to help by checking overheads at the front of the plane a staff member thought it appropriate to just shout at my daughters to sit down, when she explained she had no where to put her baggage and could not ""go against the tide"" of still boarding passengers to check the front she was told she would just have to put it in the hold, how this was going to be managed by my daughter was not mentioned and clearly the staff were not going to help - eventually another staff member did find some space and called my daughter down from her seat at the back to the front to store her baggage - not a major issue but overall the experience is one of lack of care, whilst safety should always be paramount they seem disorganised at best and uncaring at worst, helping a passenger could actually save them time in the long run and when they are obviously running late and working against a tight time frame you would think that experience would of taught them this - the whole customer service ethos has passed them by and I got the impression on both flights that passengers were very much a necessary evil and the cabin crews life would be so much better if they just didn't have to deal with them. Service not great, communication poor, every time I've flown the flight has been delayed, overall worth paying a little more for a better experience.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

They offer excellent service for outstanding value. We were a little nervous about flying out of Stansted. We needn't have been - the airport was clean and modern, we were checked in by courteous professional staff within 3 minutes of arrival. The airport has clearly spent quite a bit of modernising, although it was packed with summer holiday passengers. Onboard a very warm welcome. Older seats on way out with quite tight legroom, but on time departure and early arrival. Bags off very promptly. Returning, boarded quickly and efficiently onto a new A320 with new slimline seats that offered way more legroom. Staff were extremely professional, especially when dealing a fairly rowdy family. Early arrival into Gatwick and bags first off. In taxi within 20 minutes of landing. easyJet offers an excellent product which is streets ahead of BA in terms of price and service.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

We arrived at Gatwick 5-10 minutes early, and disembarking was as quick as boarding. On the way back, we were about half an hour early landing, which was fantastic. For the short flight from JER-LGW, easyJet are ideal and a bit better than British Airways in my opinion, and the fares are just unmissable.

We arrived at Tel Aviv to see that the flight had been delayed 50 minutes. When the time comes to board the plane we get the news that takeoff has again been delayed because the plane had reached its weight limit. The flight attendants went around offering passengers trips to different destinations in order to get them off the plane to decrease the weight. After a few passengers left, we got yet another call from the cockpit informing us that we will not be landing in Paris, but in Milan to refuel. In a matter of minutes we were airborne. Its worth mentioning that the cabin crew had the decency to offer complimentary beverages and snacks to make up for the inconvenience. The food was average, simple meals most of which are sandwiches that I do enjoy. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable. The distance between the seats was insufficient lacking legroom which made the flight uncomfortable. We arrive at Milan only to hear more bad news, we were told that the plane had hit a bird, which meant that we had to change planes. To summarise the story, we arrived at Paris CDG after an 8 hour flight, exactly double the amount of time it should have taken. We had lost half of a day on our short trip, arriving at 5:30am local Paris time instead of 12:30am. We arrived tired, with very little time to sleep.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13262415_10155046466188306_460598387_o-1-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13224342_10155046466463306_517052755_o-1-50x50.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13224994_10155046467033306_1682969538_o-1-50x50.jpg","; ; ","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13262415_10155046466188306_460598387_o-1-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13224342_10155046466463306_517052755_o-1-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13224994_10155046467033306_1682969538_o-1-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13262415_10155046466188306_460598387_o-1-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13224342_10155046466463306_517052755_o-1-500x500.jpg; http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13224994_10155046467033306_1682969538_o-1-500x500.jpg","; ; ","Aircraft

I am still waiting. In my opinion, this company charges just slightly less for flights than the national airlines because they do not spend money on customer services.

After the latest notification, we were informed that we would get voucher of 4.5 Euro for snack (only sandwich).

The latest ETD was 23.35 with ETA 00.10 and ATD was 11.31. We landed safely in Lyon, because they mentioned that GVA airport was already closed at midnight and we were not informed before. Considering the ETA was after midnight, they should have seen this possibility but, they did not mention anything to passenger before. We missed our train connection because of the delay and we arranged last minute bus travel which we missed as well due to the arrival was in Lyon. Thankfully they still managed to make bus transfer to GVA airport. We arrived in GVA around 3 AM.

My last budget airline, a certain blue and yellow operator operating from Stansted put me off - almost for life. As I was only in Milan for 24 hours, the BA Club Europe fare, the worst regional business class in the world, was a staggering £900 return. So I settled for easyJet at £160 - including row ""a"" seats on both flights. I was very pleased I did. The 1st flight left an hour late due to a bizarre ""technical"" issue. A wheelchair in the hold was found to have non detachable lithium batteries. The captain had to cross check the legality and in the end the passenger and wheelchair was deplaned. On both flights, the crew were very personable and friendly. Greeted everyone on board with a smile and ""welcome aboard"". On the return the captain did likewise. I found the seat comfortable. The plane well turned out. The return flight left on time and arrived early. Had a gin and tonic on the way back which was fairly priced. All in all a very good experience and I would not hesitate to recommend.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Everyone got on the flight with massive bags that were obviously not fit to be carried on and then had to remove the luggage from the plane. Another thing that is annoying is the non-existant entertainment system. We had a family infront of us that had ipads and laptops with them. All you have is a magazine with pictures of things you can buy, and not to mention that everything on board from foods to drinks will cost you money. There are however, meal deals where you pay 6 euros and you get a bacon sandwich, a drink, and a bag of chips. All in all just like someone else said, it will get you from point A to point B, but only if the low price is worth sacrificing food, comfort and entertainment.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Nothing special makes either flight stand out, it gets you from A to B and back again. Seats are hard and with a tight pitch so anything more than 75-90 minutes duration would be hard to put up with. All flights full, and as expected usual scramble for overhead space. Something lacking with them when compared to a regular airline - budget airline characteristic probably. Would I use them again, yes if there was no other options available.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Great flight and smooth, left on time, arrived on time, pilot was communicating at take off and during the flight and cabin crew were helpful. Paid for extra leg room as I am over 6ft 4"" was surprised at the amount of room and a nice high backed chair so room to relax, thank goodness they have removed reclining seats, nothing more annoying than somebody reclining into your face. You also notice that easyJet I would say are too nice as many passengers seem unable to read or ignore the hand baggage guidelines. So well done Easyjet for putting passengers first as you could make good money by sticking to your guidelines.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The seats on-board were relatively comfortable, legroom was average, but comfortable. There was no in-flight on screen entertainment, but there was a very interesting magazine, with plenty of articles in 5 languages. We needed to pay for food on-board, I had a hot chocolate and muffin, this was quite tasty. The flight was very smooth and the pilot dealt with turbulence well.

Flight from London Gatwick to Isle of Man was initially delayed, then cancelled. Extremely slow informing passengers of the cancellation. EasyJet clearly knew well in advance because checking on the Isle of Man arrivals board, the flight clearly showed cancelled long before EasyJet at Gatwick had the decency to inform it's passengers. The excuse given was that the crew on the inbound flight from Turin which would operate our flight had mixed up the times because of the change of clocks in the UK. Quite unbelievable. No seats available on the evening flight and ground staff didn't know about the seat availability the next day. We left Gatwick and went to another airport to get home at considerable cost.

We re-fuelled at Luxor and flew back to Hurghada, and crew dealt with this in a professional and understanding way. Concerning seats on the A320, outbound we had the 'old' seats, and on the return flight we had the new seats. We were able to make direct comparison. Our verdict is that the new seats offer more legroom and are more stable and comfortable. I was relieved to see that the seats do not recline, a big reason that we select EasyJet. One criticism is that on the return flight the cabin crew had run out of food (rolls, baguettes, etc) by the time they reached us. We were told that this is a frequent thing. I noted that they had plenty of duty free perfumes and goods to sell. I would suggest more food is loaded at Gatwick and less perfumes etc.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Crew were really nice and helpful and even though they don't give out any drinks you can buy them on board for reasonable prices along with snacks, they also sell bus tickets to Rome city center which is helpful and save you time at the airport.

Sheer bloody lack of consideration. When we eventually boarded the captain informed us that there would be a delay because they needed an engineer to come and update the maps for BCN airport. Again the plane had been standing there overnight surely the maps could have been updated then. Then to cap it all a passenger who had checked in had failed to turn up so we had a further delay whilst they found and removed their bags (admittedly not EJs fault). The flight itself was uneventful and the landing at BCN was one of the best (smoothest) we've experienced in many years. We will continue to use easyJet but they really should be more professional when it comes to boarding.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Check in fine until you get to board, then staff were telling women that their handbags had to go in their hand luggage as only one bag was allowed, this was not a full flight so the hold up was not too bad. Flight itself was a non event, staff friendly enough. Never buy food or drink onboard. Flight arrived early. Would fly it again as with budget airlines only if the price is right.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The first was in 1997. It hasn't improved much in terms of Customer Service. I have avoided it this long but it was inevitable this time around as I wasn't paying for the trip myself so I had budget constrain. Flew from London Gatwick to Lisbon. Let's start with the booking process. This was easy and straightforward, living up to its name. However, the additional charges for bags and seats (although I knew about it) still irked me. It really should be standard. How can any airline charge their customers for choosing where to sit? Afterall, we are already paying to fly. The bags - less said. Anyway, the London Gatwick experience was so-so. If you're not an easyJet Plus customer you can't bring anything else apart from one cabin bag-not even a small handbag. I think this is just ridiculous. A handbag is like a 5th limb for most people. Having said that, when returning, the staff at the boarding gate in Lisbon terminal 2 (budget airlines only terminal), allowed the passenger in front of me to carry her handbag which was almost as big as her cabin bag. She wasn't an easyJet Plus customer as those who were went through another lane. She was told to queue like we all were. This inconsistency is what lets easyJet down. I have to say, their pilots on both leg of the journey were brilliant. High winds, but not a bump when landing. The bag drop process in Gatwick was smooth. The one in Lisbon was so-so (might have to do with it being a budget terminal). Calling you to the gate 45 minutes before departure and then to go through passport control was a very silly set-up. It meant everyone was anxious and rushing and in a bad mood. But that's the termnal's fault. Easyjet - if I have the means, I would never fly it. The only other airline worst than easyjet is Ryanair (which I flew with once 20 years ago and never again).","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I'd checked in online and that was a very simple process. The staff at the gate and onboard were extremely friendly. The cabin was clean and welcoming, the seats even reclined! We were on time taking off and landed 5-10 minutes early. The way back was the same, however the staff at the gate weren't as friendly and were extremely slow! We boarded 15 minutes late but got into Jersey 5 minutes early. I'd definitely fly with easyJet again, as there isn't much different between them and airlines such as British Airways.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I put an abbreviated version of a name accidentally on a ticket, and they wanted to charge €65 each way, for a simple name change. I decided I didn't care about the leg room because it was going to be such a short flight. I arrive at the airport, and the board of departures shows the flight is in check-in and the gate will be determined. 20 minutes before the take off time, passengers receive a text saying flight is canceled until next day. Obviously you can imagine the troubles this would bring, and I can only help easyjet will redeem itself slightly by refunding my entire flight, and paying for the new train tickets I'll have to buy.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I queued up very early (only a few passengers in front of me) to ensure I got onboard fastly and I could put my bag in. When I reached the door of the plane the ground staff tried to snatch the bag from me but I asked why as the overhead lockers were empty - I explained I was going straight to a wedding reception and that my dress was at the top of my case ironed and ready to put on and this is why I had a seat and the front of the plane and queued early - they were kind and understood and told me to speak to the crew. I then encountered a very smug crew who didn't want to know about my need or wouldn't explain why my bag was being offloaded when it was still empty - he said it was a full flight but surely it's first come first served for baggage space? To which he sang with a big smile on his face ""you have agreed to the terms and conditions when you bought the ticket, so if you don't like it please leave!"" I was in shock of this and had to ask again to make sure I heard right - asking me to leave because I had asked why I couldn't put it there when it was empty - absolutely no empathy or warmth and seemed to take pleasure from it and made eyes with another crew. He then instructed them to remove my bag and wasn't asked if I needed to take anything from it - I later realised I was left without money or my motion sickness medication and didn't feel comfortable to ask if my bag could be retrieved due to the unapproachable crew - this made the flight miserable. The captain did make a PA to apologise for offloaded bags after landing which was professional, so was it too much for the crew to use his discretion and be human or atleast apologise for the situation also?!","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Booking and online check-in was smooth. Boarding was a mess both times, probably due to the cabin baggage allowance at low cost carriers. People had huge carryons and because the flights were full, there was nowhere near enough space for all those carryons. Both flights were more or less punctual and uneventful. The cabin crews were friendly, the cabins itself a bit dirty. Typical low cost flights. But value for money was good, so I recommand them.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers. As the price was quite cheap, I would use Easyjet again but I think their cabin baggage policy needs to be stricter as people will always try to break the rules.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated ""right, it doesn’t fit it will have to be checked in"". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay £45 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied ""well you won’t be flying then"". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn’t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her ""well trained"" staff couldn’t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager’s response was simply ""ok, yes it can go in with you"". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet £45 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet? This is easily the most appalling treatment I have received as a customer. I will make every effort, even at personal expense and inconvenience, to fly with other airlines.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Outward journey was fine: prompt departure, uneventful flight, efficient - if slightly low key - cabin crew, slightly early arrival. Return journey was delayed because the original incoming aircraft had had to be replaced, but easyJet did what it could to keep us informed. An agent came and waited at the gate for an hour or so to tell passengers of the delay and to provide updates, only leaving when the first of the proper boarding staff arrived. She had actually ended up trying to field more inquiries from passengers waiting at the next gate for a delayed shared Heathrow flight than from easyJet customers. From the time the plane finally arrived, boarding was very swiftly organised and completed in less than half an hour. The flight itself was uneventful and we made up a little time en route, eventually arriving about 90 minutes late. At no time had there been any significant fuss or complaint about the delay, probably because an effort was made to keep us informed.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I don't agree with the fact that your not allowed to take handbags on board if you already have a carry on especially when it's OK to do so on all other airlines. What are woman supposed to do with their purses, passports, phones and feminine products, you don't really want to be delving into your hand luggage all the time especially when it's in the overhead lockers.

At boarding one of the party was singled out and her cabin bag was found to be to big - this is in spite of it being deemed the correct size in the measuring receptacle at check in and in spite of the fact that another passenger with exactly the same cabin bag was waived through. When the party finally boarded there was no locker room so obviously they had to get rid of a few. We would happily have checked our cabin bags in at check in but were told there was no room. She had to pay £45 and has been refused a refund. The service on the plane was non existent the cabin crew spent 30 minutes eating their breakfasts and ignoring the needs of the passengers. Will not fly with them again.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Boarding seemed quite fast, but onboard we were told that we missed our slot and we should wait one hour on the runaway for another slot. We ended up in Milan with a delay exceeding 1 hour (out of the 3 easyjet flights I booked in the last 12 months, none of them was on time). Flight attendants were reasonably friendly and seats reasonably comfortable. Albeit a low-cost airline, flight price was expensive, maybe because of the close proximity to Christmas (18 Dec).","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We paid an additional 50GBP to change the name on my ticket; somehow when my husband booked our four flights for four separate days in four separate airports, the easyjet website processed this particular flight under my husband's name twice for two seats, instead of mine for the second passenger's ticket.

We were fully aware of the baggage policy of Easyjet before we booked our domestic flight and chose to book and pay for one bag to go into the hold. Due to flooding around Crawley, our train suffered long delays and we got to the airport with minutes to spare for boarding, missing the bag drop deadline. I had to go to the gate with my cabin size case and a medium handbag where the attendants rudely harrasssed me for £45 and forced me to put my case into the hold. They didn't give a monkeys that I had already paid to put a bag into the hold! And £45? What annoyed me even more was that the flight was only 75% full so my case could have easily fit in to the overhead locker! And only one piece of baggage for a woman? Once home I requested through their customer services department some apology for the way I was treated but didn't get one, even after going through Twitter.

My experience with easyJet was not good. On my first flight to London, the plane was delayed. But that isn't a big deal. I flew with hand luggage plus a backpack from Stuttgart to London without problem. On my return flight, apparently this was a problem. I was told at the gate I needed to check my hand luggage and bring my backpack on board. Normally I'd store the hand luggage in the above compartment and the backpack underneath. I reluctantly paid £45 to have the privilege of checking my bag. I then boarded the plane, stored my backpack in the above compartment only to be told that backpacks are only stored under the seat. I see no reason why I could not bring my now checked luggage on board with me. I'm very disappointed with this procedure.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I don't ask for much on short flights of this nature apart from a reasonably on time departure and arrival, so I am rarely moved to write a review. However, on this occasion I think the attitude of the young man in charge of the cabin left a lot to be desired. We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an ""upfront fee"" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: ""Excuse me Sir"" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology. They simply resumed their conversation about Christmas gifts they had received.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We were a family of 8. Ranging from 6 - 70 years old. My 70 year old father hurt his knee whilst we were away so was walking with crutches. When we arrived at the airport we asked for a wheelchair it never arrived. He walked from terminal 1-3. We queued to book in, again asked for a wheelchair. They told my parents to sit and wait and a wheelchair would arrive. They told us the rest of our group had to carry on through passport control leaving my father with my mother to wait for the chair. They never checked on them to see and the wheelchair never arrived. My dad then had to walk through security and a 15 min walk to the boarding area. When they arrived in the boarding lounge they told us what had happened. Dad sat down on one of the chairs and a staff tripped over his bad leg. She only turned around when my mum lept to try and cover his bad leg. She didn't stop to see if he was okay. I asked another staff if he could have assistance from the boarding lounge to the plane - she said she had to see his boarding pass, checked it and said it's not written on his boarding pass. She begrudgingly let him go to the front of the queue. A very disappointing journey that could have easily been different if any of the staff had taken time to deal with the situation properly. To say we are angry at the level of customer service provided by easy jet would be an understatement!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Then it all turned pear shaped. The Captain told us there would be a maximum delay of 1hr 10mins because of computer issues at Brest air traffic control. We finally set off 1.5 hrs later with no further warnings or explanations. We had paid for extra leg room seats, but were not warned that for the person sitting nearest the window in row 1 (the only extra leg room seats) was limited by the slide stowage, so it was only okay if you had no left leg! The seats were like church pews, upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch! This despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright! After about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. We were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. Cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness, rather than efficient. The descent into Funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a ""missed approach"" due to the cross winds being outside the aircraft's limits. We briefly joined a holding pattern, but were diverted to Gran Canaria. We were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt. As it was now nearly six hours since we last ate, we asked for some food. We were told they could not serve hot food now and anyway all the food would have gone off and not be fit to eat! Instead they handed out complementary pringles/crisps and plastic cups of water! After at least an hour, the pilot decided to return to Funchal make another attempt to land. If that failed he would take us to ""mainland Europe."" The descent was much smoother and the landing was achieved. We finally landed 5 hrs after our allotted time at 12.20am! It was a relief to disembark after 9hrs on the aircraft. Fortunately, our car hire had stayed open for our flight, so we were able to get ourselves to a hotel and find a room for the night, as it was now too late to pick up the key to the apartment we were renting. We have since discovered that earlier flights by other airlines took their passengers to other islands and paid for overnight accommodation. Easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour - there being no taxis at the airport! Whilst the circumstances were not all the fault of Easyjet, and, indeed, we had expected problems with the landing, this airline made a bad situation many times worse by their appalling attitude and shoddy service. Suffice it to say we are not looking forward to the return journey, after which we would never travel with them again!","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Crew were professional and were always near when you needed something. You don't get any meal or drinks, but prices on board are reasonable, I also like that they were selling bus tickets to Rome onboard. I'll fly with them next time for sure.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

So straight to security which had a very short queue at 05:00. I had purchased an exit row Extra Legroom seat (13D) which also allowed me an extra, albeit smaller, item of hand luggage and Speedy Boarding. This was well worth the additional cost. At the gate, which was posted approximately 50 minutes before departure, I was impressed that gate staff were politely but firmly enforcing their hand baggage policy. For example a group in front of me were requested to pack their hand bags into their wheelie bags as they were allowed only one piece on board. Speedy Boarding was honoured and well policed with other passengers being politely asked to wait when they tried to board. However we then had to wait 5-10 minutes standing on the airbridge until we were allowed on board. Onboard I had no problem getting my bags up in the locker near me. This aircraft had the new seating and the legroom in this exit row seat was superb. The crew were very friendly and professional. My only criticism was that on a flight duration of 4h 30 mins they could easily have done more than two runs with the food and drinks trolley service. I would have bought another drink if they had! We departed early and arrived early and disembarkation was swift. Unfortunately progress through passport control was slow as there were only two immigration officers on duty in Paphos. This was my first experience of Easyjet and I'd fly with them again.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Apart from one significant delay in Corfu because of weather, we have never had any problems with any of our flights. The existence of easyJet (and to a lesser extent, Ryanair) has allowed us to travel frequently and cheaply, which would have been impossible 20 years ago, so thank you for that, easyJet. Yes, one can be picky and identify minor irritations at times, e.g. on this latest flight to Malaga we were marginally late leaving Liverpool because boarding was delayed despite this being the plane's first flight of the day. Such gripes are trivial, however, in comparison with the efficient and good-humoured service provided by all the easyJet staff we have encountered over the years. The slightly tardy departure apart, this flight more than lived up to the usual standard, with a bonus of an anniversary token for everyone on board.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Why should passengers from Cyprus subsidise the outbound flight. Customer services cannot give any reasonable explanation for this difference in cost. Come on Easyjet, give us a break.

After boarding in Corfu a fault was discovered with the aircraft and it would not be taking off. Passengers were bussed to the terminal to collect luggage, boarded coaches to a hotel for the night, with breakfast included. The next morning we checked in, the boards told us departure time was changed by two hours. Refreshments and sandwiches laid on for delayed passengers at the café. Easyjet in my opinion did well. It was the best delay handling I've experienced. A week later I checked their compensation policy and online submission was easy! Eight days later 800EUR was paid into our bank account.

Easyjet refused to allow us to check in bags because bag drop had closed. Staff at check in said the baggage drop closes at the original,specified time irrespective of any delay to flight - even if announced on website. Fortunately our cases were small enough to go as hand luggage. However my elderly 87 year old mother had oversize liquids, scissors etc which of course were picked up at x-Ray. Fortunately when we explained what had happened the security official took pity and zipped up her case without confiscating the items which surprised me.

First of all, they urge you to check in online saying there aren't any check in counters at the airport, only luggage drop-off (which isn't true of course). Anyway, I wanted to play the game and tried to check in online. My first try was 7 hours before departure. I had several other tries but each time the internet site told me to check in at the airport. There, they told me that my flight was over-booked (this seems to be a common policy of easyJet and often, there are enough people who do not come). Well of course, this time not. There was only one easyJet employee (who was totally over-charged with workload) at the customer service who told me to wait briefly. The queue of people became longer and longer (there seems to be lots of queries and complaints with easyJet) and I ended up waiting several hours. Ironically, easyJet writes on their boarding passes ""don't be late the others can't wait"" (yeah right, and I can?) and ""next time, why not check-in online"" (well I tried to but their site wouldn't let me).

However my most recent experience, a return journey between Gatwick and Edinburgh, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding boarding. At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them. Overall I do like easyJet but their boarding procedures are becoming inconsistent and a tad shambolic.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

There was an odd one or two and I mean two max who were bordering on half pleasant. Flight was delayed but we were still herded onto the plane and sat there with a 4 hr delay, we were eventually maybe after 3hr and 45 minutes offered a plastic cup half full of water which you had to go to the back of the plane for. Granted - mid air we were offered a drink and pringles or a chocolate bar, but you would have thought the cabin crew were paying for this out of their own pocket. It was begrudged. I would say nearly all if not all passengers were from the north west, and even though we were cooped up, passengers were annoyed and fed up, but there was still a good banter amongst the passengers. Easyjet take note you could have had a lot of irate, angry passengers to deal with and quite rightly so.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I have never seen such a confusion in a waiting area and so confused staff on a plane searching several time the same empty boxes for whatever. It seemed to me that the staff had come to this plane by surprise. Like we did with the delay. The staff was very friendly but obviously not on their right plane.

Return journey was on time and both flights smooth. As a nervous flyer I wasn't expecting much on a cheap flight but the staff could not have been more attentive. The cabin manager was fantastic, even to the extent of introducing me to the pilot and co pilot. Both of whom reassured me and asked if I was OK when we landed. Although of course its ridiculous, I tend to stick to certain airlines I feel slightly more confident using. easyJet have not previously been on my list but will be in the future. The pre booked allocated seats were comfortable and for me the customer service was first class.

The staff at the Newcastle were polite, friendly and helpful. The return journey was horrendous. I have never been to Bristol airport and asked at the easyJet desk where I needed to go (myself and family already had 'speedy boarding cards') - the assistant on the desk spoke to me like I was something she had trod in saying in a cold manner 'You don't need to be here, you don't have luggage do you? , just go up the stairs over there'. So I went to the Aspire Lounge until the TV screen showed which Gate I needed to be at to board my flight home. When the screens did show me where my gate was, the time was 15.45 at gate 15, so we made our way towards the gate. I happened to spot a sign on a wall that said it was a seven minute walk from this sign to gate 15. Whilst walking down the corridor I was watching the info screens and noticed that gate 15 had changed from 'boarding' to 'closing' - the time on the screen was 15.51. Everyone on that now started to run down the corridor in fear that they would not make the flight. My elderly parents were flying with me and my mother is asthmatic so she cannot run or even walk quickly. How is anyone supposed to make a flight when they are not given enough time to comfortably walk a route. Everyone was complaining about this and the staff just shrugged their shoulders and said in a muttered tone 'You got here didn't you?'. That is not the attitude I expect from a professional company. This was my first experience of an easyJet flight and it will also be my last. My advice to Bristol easyJet staff is to remember your customers pay your wages, treat them with respect and have a friendly attitude. My overall rating is 5/10 and the 5 is for the staff at the Newcastle, Bristol easyJet staff get nothing.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I've had to call them and the insurance company several times to clear this up, and in the end, both myself and my travel companion are out for the cost of this flight. No where on the site did it make clear that the policy is only valid for Italian citizens, and the insurance company representative said that this is a very common problem for all citizens worldwide who purchase a flight through EasyJet.

My airline to Australia had no other seats available until two weeks later so I had to get back that day. The woman I spoke to just gave me a really cold look and basically made it clear she couldn't care less about me the customer. Offered me no help, and all I got was indifference which was even more upsetting. Luckily for me a kind stranger saw me in tears and calmed me down enough for me to get it together and eventually get on a BA flight to London City Airport which got me to London in time.

We were notified the day before our flight from Santorini to Manchester, that the flight had been cancelled. After a lot of messing about and little support from Easyjet. We got a flight a day later to London Gatwick. We incurred significant cost getting back to Manchester and submitted our receipts to easyJet to claim compensation. We flew to Gatwick on the 6th August - it is now the 25th of September and they have still not settled our claim even though I had to pay the extra travel cost almost 2 months ago. What is most annoying is that when we were in Santorini trying to contact easyJet to see what our options were - you could not get through to customer services (we were on hold for over an hour!). I have called them since my return 5 times (the average hold time is over 30 minutes) and although they promise to sort this out and say a manager will call back, they lie - they don't sort it out and don't call back. As a travel editor I regularly use low cost airlines - Jet2, Ryanair etc. and I have to say the lack of customer service make easyJet the worst I have come across. I will certainly never use them again. You can't trust easyJet to be there for you and to sort out problems. Think carefully before you book!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I had serious doubts that easyJet would pay up. To this day they have promised to look at my out of pocket expenses, but they do not answer the phone and if you email them you get an automated response but no real reply.

Because it was an early morning flight we had to book a hotel nearby. The one plus is being able to check in your bag the night before to save time in the morning. The staff doing that told us to hurry as she was about to go off shift and we would have had to wait for her replacement to arrive! Next morning we did just breeze through however. We were in the South terminal. What a horrible terminal. The only upside was we had a gate were we actually boarded using a plane bridge instead of the stairs! Onboard the crew were very nice and the plane clean and tidy. I find their on board menu options overpriced and they never seem to have the items I want anyway! The flight to Paphos is over 4 hours and easyJet seats don't recline (even though they tell you make sure your seat is in the upright position) and there is no head rest support. easyJet planes are like sitting on a park bench. Nice for a little while, but eventually you want to move on. But you can't. The whole plane got fidgety because they were so uncomfortable. These no frills flights are fine for short trips but for mid haul like this they really need to have more comfort features built in to their seats etc. I wouldn't contemplate them for flights over 2 hours unless there was no full service airline available.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The captain explained and kept us informed of progress. The repair meant no air conditioning for a time, but aircraft doors and the flight deck windows were left open and passengers who needed air were allowed to stand by the doors. Everyone was offered water. We eventually left over an hour late but made up a little time en route. We hadn't been comfortable waiting on a hot plane, but there was no fuss because we knew why.

The selection of snacks and beverages was decent but pricey. There was some confusion at EDI before the return flight as first there was a 15 minute delay announced but then they seemed to change their minds. Only a few minutes after the gate number first appeared on the screen they started announcing that they were about to close the gate. After sprinting across the terminal I found a decent queue at the gate so I figured this was some sort of a scare tactic to rush passengers to the gate, it felt a bit dishonest.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Great terminal with enough shops and great views at some locations, especially Cafe Rouge. Boarding the plane was a bit hectic as everyone is supposed to just charge at once. Felt a bit like I was in a herd of cattle. Once on the plane I headed to my reserved seat. The flights to and from Toulouse were quick without distruption. I knew EasyJet is a budget airline so I expected the worst however to my surprise the Airbus A319 I travelled on was very modern and the seats were very comfortable with a generous amount of legroom. During the flight I noticed that the crew were there for your safety and nothing else. All of the crew were French so asking for anything might have been a challenge. Every announcement was in French and then (with difficulty) translated into English. I was a bit surprised considering it's an english airline but maybe these flights are run by another division of the airline to suit the majority of the passengers on board. Overall I was impressed by their 'no frills' service and would recommend flying with Easyjet on their short european routes.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

They cancelled the flight to Aberdeen on Monday. About 10 minutes after they had directed all the passengers to the gate, (3 hours late) the flight was cancelled and 200 passengers were told to go and see the customer services agent in the departure area. Of course there was no one there. Eventually a single rep turned up and had to deal with us all. After 30 minutes those with no baggage we were led away, those of us with hold bags waited another 30 minutes before we could reclaim our bags and join the queue for a taxi to the Copthorne Hotel. The promised a shuttle bus but it never materialised. The boarding passes issued for the replacement flight the following day sent all passengers to the wrong terminal. It takes longer to get from the Gatwick runway to the terminal exits than it does to fly from Aberdeen to Gatwick. There is always a palava getting off, no steps, no chocks. Too windy. Then a bus to the wrong terminal: the final insult. As I sit here waiting for the flight home easyJet are once again apologising for the late departure of the flight to Gatwick. Not their fault: it never is.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The easyJet A319 fleet is really showing its age, particularly where seats are concerned. On the outward leg, every time the chap next to me moved in his seat, mine moved with it, and vice versa. On return leg, the cloth behind the in flight tray was severley worn. Departed 1 hour late from LTN, due to late arrival of inbound aircraft. Bad weather was delaying all departures and arrivals. Quick turn around on the ground at Luton however, good hard working crew, and the run u to Inverness only took 1 hour, despite it being timed at 1hr 25m. Inbound early to arrive at INV, so early departure and early arrival at LTN, again flight time less than the 1hr 20m scheduled. Good crew again. Fourth easyJet flight in a period of 3 weeks, and can't really knock them. Only chose easyJet as BA does not fly this route anymore.

Even with the travel time and train or car park extras it was worth the saving. Hand bags only, so nothing to check in, but it wouldn't have been a problem as there were so few people at the check in desks. Southend Airport only has around 20 flights a day so it wasn't crowded except when we queued for our flight. Boarding was slow as they made most people check that their bag fitted in the measuring device. Onboard you could see why as there wasn't much space for bags if you were late. We were two thirds of the way in the queue and just managed to get our bags in, but some rows from the seats. I wish we'd been with our bags further up as we had parents with a toddler behind us that kept kicking the seat, putting it's hands through the gap etc. I know this wasn't easyJet's fault, but glad it was only a short flight. Despite the short length, the seats are still hard and lack neck support. So glad to get off at the end. At Amsterdam it was a new experience using the ""G"" gates. These are low cost I assume as we had to up and down stairs in the terminal as well as from the plane Coming back we got to the gate earlyish so we were in the queue to get onboard quickly and got our bags above our seats. Prompt loading and good to see the crew helping load bags to get the flight away on time. Looong taxi to the runway. Took 10 mins to pass the ""regular"" D gates BA/KLM use for UK flights. However departure was ontime and with flying time of 35 mins back to Southend, can't complain. Off the plane and through immigration in about 10 mins. Easyjet offer a bus service in the air, a no frills trip. It's fine as it got us from A to B and back again but could improve the comfort of it's seats. The seats are the only thing you will have interaction with if you don't check in a bag or buy some of the overpriced on board food, so it would do them a world of good to improve the comfort of them.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

On the last leg of our honeymoon, my husband and decided to book Easyjet because it was cheaper than other airlines for an hour and a half flight. Big mistake. We got to the airport at 10.45 am for our 1.20 pm flight. Right away they notified us at the baggage drop that our flight was delayed two hours due to a ""technical difficulty."" About an hour before the delayed flight time, we were notified at the gate that the flight was delayed another two hours due to a ""technical difficulty."" We went downstairs to customer service to discuss our options. The representative was hostile and extremely rude, telling us that the only option was to wait. We wasted the entire day at the airport and will miss all of our reservations. The best part is today is my husband's birthday. In fairness, I know all airlines experience technical difficulties from time to time, but it seems much more frequent of an issue with Easyjet (see Easyjet reviews). Spend a little more and book with a reputable airline to avoid spending a full day of your precious vacation at the airport.","","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image421-e1440601653460-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image421-e1440601653460-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image421-e1440601653460-500x500.jpg","","Type Of Traveller

Going out about one hour late, returning about two hours late. The cause were a series of operational problems: in the first plane the hold door had to be opened and closed manually and the second the plane had a puncture due to picking up a screw. I could forgive one such problem; two strikes me as that there may be grounds to operational management issues at this airline. It seems to me that EasyJet does not have the capability to operate its program at the rate it is trying to do. Particularly for short flights with rapid turnaround. My advice to passengers is fly early in the day. Late on they will have encountered problems and you will have no idea what time you will travel.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We didn't have bags but did get to the airport very early. Outbound: EZY8995, 14.40 (15.30)-17.05 (17.37), July 28th. Once in the departure lounge a 12 min delay was posted with the inbound aircraft 30 mins late. Around 30 mins before scheduled time of departure we got told to go to gate 52. Boarding was predominately hassle free but people could just walk on the plane. We pushed back at 15.00 and left Gatwick at 15.30 which was 50 mins late. The cabin crew were friendly and did apologise a few times for the delay. The food was quite expensive but still not as bad as Ryanair. We landed at 17.37 and deboarding was done quickly. The delay was acceptable as it was the 3rd return flight of the day in the summer. Inbound: EZY8996, 12.35( 13.25)-12.50 (13.20), August 5th. Once in the departure lounge a 25 min delay was posted. We boarded quickly around 10 mins after the aircraft arrived and were off quickly and on time. We were advised a flying time of 50 mins which is extremely quick in comparison to the average duration therefore service was rushed. However it was good to catch up with the delay. All in all the easy jet service was normal and the delays were bearable for the peak summer season. Flights costs £95 per person with row 7 seats pre-booked.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Informed by flight deck that there were some ""lumps and bumps"" en route back to Luton, a term I have only heard on BA before. It was bumpy, but not too distressing, and I always think it is a good thing to be informed before departure - forewarned is forearmed. Did not try catering as did not enjoy it on outward leg. We opted instead to purchase something at Malaga Airport. Good hardworking crew, good announcements and info en route. Another nod in the direction of BA, charity collection and Captain saying goodbye to disembarking passengers. Next easyJet flight for me will be next week to Inverness.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Not too bad actually, and leg room was quite good. No issues with finding selected seats. Five minutes late departing due to some issues with rear door boarding, and then 5 minutes late into Malaga. This is the first time I have flown easyJet in a number of years, and I am glad to report that they have upped their game. No more silly announcements about placing your unwanted children in overhead lockers, or smokers will be evicted mid-air. They were professional, and hard working. Good announcements from flight deck and crew. They seem to have adopted some of BA practices, such as collection for charity (Unicef) and Captain waiting to say goodbye to disembarking passengers. Only downside, I could not recommend the bacon baguette, and my wife could not recommend the ham and cheese toastie. Overall good experience.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Newer aircraft with upgraded seating etc. Seats are much slimmer, less padding and therefore very uncomfortable, larger gaps between, no built in headrest, legroom appears less. Rows are now slightly staggered. Presumably new seating has allowed an extra few seats to be fitted and are clearly much lighter than older, more comfortable seats. The design of the seats does not allow anyone in seats other than aisle to see the safety demonstration. I am 6 ft tall and really struggled to watch demonstration and knees reached seat base in front. Have flown many times on Easyjet over many years but this was one of the most uncomfortable and is clearly a retrograde step in my opinion.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Was flying from Luton Airport to Nice on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy. Good experience with EasyJet would advise booking early for cheaper flights but if your able to be flexible that also helps. Overall good experince with EasyJet and looking forward to our return journey with the airline.","","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image233-e1438082354108-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image233-e1438082354108-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image233-e1438082354108-500x500.jpg","","Aircraft

Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight – wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner. The captain made up for the late start, and we arrived on time in Copenhagen.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We checked bags and carried hand luggage. Cramped and uncomfortable seating, along with expensive food on board, this unfortunately becoming the norm for this level of airline, so no surprises. Returning (Heraklion to Manchester) however ended with further expense just prior to boarding. We checked the same bag for the hold as before no problem and carried the same bags, but afterwards we received very disorganised information from the easyJet staff at this airport. Waiting to board the plane at the gate we were singled out in the line by an particular easyJet staff member and to some extent made an example off. The issue initially involved my fiancée carrying an over the shoulder purse as this is apparently one extra piece of hand luggage. I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fiancée's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional €55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff). Uncomfortable, no entertainment, limited and lastly not that particular inexpensive flight. We hope to fly with a more reputable airline in the future.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet's ""midnight check-in"" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I'd paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn't find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay €100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I've had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins. Bags took a while to come out. Overall, a satisfactory journey, but they need to drop the ""low-cost"" moniker and go back to being called a no frills airline as that's what it is with all the charges you pay.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Of course we could not accomplish this. The agent then informed us they would have to be checked at £45 per bag fee, and this could not be done until all others had boarded the plane. We could have bought the two rollerbags a seat on the plane for half that amount of money. After tagging our bags, the agents did not seem to be able to figure out how to charge us so they told us to give our bags to the luggage handler at the bottom of the airplane steps and get on the flight, which we were holding up at that point. We felt very manipulated and embarrassed and will not use this airline again, despite its favorable pricing. It's a great bargain as long as you travel naked!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We made a round of all the shops in town that could help us, but they could not, we went back and tried many ways, at last after many many attempts we had this boarding press printed. A real nightmare and a loss of time. Moreover to bring the guitar in the cabin I had to pay 50 euros. I really would not recomend it.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We were due to fly out of Paris through Easyjet to Berlin. Our flight was at 7 am. We arrived at the airport 1.5 hours in advance only to find out the airline requires you to check-in online. The clerk argued that it was too late. How is it possible that they could give our seats away when there was still 1.5 hours left until our flight left. In any case, they were not helpful in trying to book another flight. They were fully booked for days. We ended up taking the shuttle to a different airport and booking a more expensive flight for 13 hours later.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We were going to fly with Air France but their cheaper flights sold out too quickly and we missed out. Apparently there was a fire at FCO in May so they changed us to CIA but only gave me 2 days notice, which I was annoyed about. Turned out to be a blessing because we flew out of FCO and it was Crazy. I highly recommend CIA. Our flight was on time, no delays. Staff were pleasant. The seats were comfortable. I paid $12 extra for extra leg room so our carry on bags would be guaranteed to fit, as we weren't checking luggage. We both fell asleep promptly and missed any drink service or entertainment. I checked in online, knew all about the fees and charges so as long as you are prepared it shouldn't come as a shock. Either way, zero delays, zero issues, cheap flight.

There seemed to be more space generally so it was a good flight. Left early and arrived early. Check-in at Bristol was well organised with all check-in desks open so little waiting. A different story at Madeira airport. We queued for best part of an hour to check-in. The whole thing was a complete shambles and there were some heated exchanges between passengers who tried to push in. We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run. Since they had run out of most snacks early on the first run perhaps they thought it wasn't worth doing a second (although a drink of some kind would have been welcome). Overall easyjet is my airline of choice when travelling in Europe as it is now on par with BA or other national carriers.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The cabin crew on this flight from Bristol were especially nice and were really good with children, which was nice as I was travelling with my two young nephews. I didn't bother with anything from the in-flight service so can't comment on that. My seat was fine as well, although the seating generally looked like it could do with a bit of refurb soon.

Largely due to the chaotic nature of Bordeaux airport. This involved a cattle like holding area for passengers waiting to board the flight. We were held there for ages before being allowed onto the plane and it was really uncomfortable with nowhere to sit and a single file queueing area in place. Once onboard the flight was very busy. The cabin crew did a good job really, especially as there were one or two disruptive passengers on board who were pretty rude to one flight attendant in particular. Other than that, the flight went very quickly. I was going to get something from the in-flight service, having not been able to pick something up at the airport, but it was slow coming round (despite the fact I was only in row 9) so we were making our descent by the time they got to me.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Being disabled, I requested assistance on both journeys. The staff at Edinburgh were superb both times, but the staff at Luton were almost non-existent. On arrival at Luton, we were taken to the baggage hall and told to sit at the side where we would be attended to. I could see my case going round and round and it was eventually removed and taken to me by another passenger. When an attendant eventually arrived, after a very long time, he was rushed off his feet, as there was such a shortage of staff. On the return journey, I was almost reduced to tears. I rang from the booth for disabled assistance, and was assured someone would be with me as soon as possible. I rang twice more and both times was assured someone was on the way. Eventually, a very kind parking attendant went to investigate matters and someone arrived within 10 minutes, by which time I was almost passing out with the heat, as it was like sitting in a greenhouse with the sun beating down and I had waited an hour and a quarter! Again, the attendant was run off his feet through lack of staff and I had not even been checked in (so much for having to arrive 90 minutes before the flight!). As it was, the plane was late, otherwise I would have missed my flight. Having said all that, all staff were very civil, but it did turn my lovely holiday into a nightmare. If Easyjet are committed to helping disabled people have a smooth journey from start to finish, they need to get their act together and liaise with OES re passenger assistance, especially in this day and age. May I add that the cabin crews were most helpful, as were the OES staff at Edinburgh where the service is most professional.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Outbound flight: delayed by 1.5 hours due to original Airbus A320 (180 seats) out of action due to technical issues (Easyjet excuse) so eventually transferred to Airbus A319 (only 156 seats). Tight squeeze and confusion for many of where to sit and many family members split. This plane was looking it's age inside and rattled a lot. It was one of the spare ones used specifically for breakdowns. Inbound flight: Delayed by 2 hours. Okay this airport has had a fire but please it was a month ago! Tannoy systems should be fixed by now. This may not be Easyjets fault but consider this: The flight was EZY5260. There was nothing on the electronic screens to show that this flight even existed (despite an Easyjet representative saying that the flight was erased it was never on the boards as we were at the airport for many hours). At the departure terminal 2 there was no information but after several enquiries to airport staff we were asked to go to terminal 3. No information and nobody to consult. There was even a young Easyjet employee who was travelling on an earlier flight (there were several to the UK all delayed) who was as perplexed as we were). At last after further enquiries and looking at the Easyjet website on phones the reason given for the delay was that a technical fault was the excuse. Easyjet are not at fault on the airport issues but I think they could do a lot better. Replacing ageing aircraft is a must and leaving passengers in the dark is inexcusable. Even though the pilot apologized for the delay it's not the delay at all it's the lack of common sense and dialogue that exasperates passengers. I've been in similar positions with other airlines. What do they do? Obtain a large white card describe the problem and where to go and have a rep at the terminal as described. It's not rocket science is it? The marks given are for poor customer relations and not the flight or pilot or flight attendants who were probably as cheesed off as the passengers for working later than anticipated.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As usual it was a straightforward flight with no problems. The cabin crew were efficient and polite and because of the short duration of the flight were quite busy. There was a number of disabled passengers including me who required assistance to disembark. Unfortunately the vehicle used for this was busy elsewhere and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get off. The Easyjet crew were very apologetic and the Captain herself came back and stayed to chat with us while we waited which I thought was a good bit of customer service. Once in the baggage reclaim area there was another slight delay as the conveyor belt would not start. The attitude of some passengers was appalling. The one airport employee present was constantly badgered about what was happening. All he could say was the engineers were trying to fix it and the duty manager was on his way. This evidently was not good enough for some and they registered their displeasure by behaving in a rude and arrogant fashion to both the one employee present and the duty manager when he arrived. The belt started and all luggage was offloaded and collected after about 30minutes not exactly a catastrophe but to some it was as if Easyjet (who were not responsible for any delay) and the Management at Luton Airport had deliberately conspired to cause a problem for their amusement. People should be more tolerant and if time is truly important perhaps allow time for possible or even probable delays.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It did however seem that boarding took a bit longer than it should have because of some delay in letting passengers on in addition to the general confusion with so many passengers trying to find space in the overhead compartments. In general though the flight went okay it just seems the inefficiency in their boarding process has consistently added time whenever I have travelled with EasyJet both this time and in the past. I also of course did not like how the seats do not recline but I suppose that's another issue.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Flight out on 18/4/15 was excellent. Took off on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Plane looked to be a new A320 with new thin seats which were surprisingly comfortable and seemed to give plenty of room. Return flight on 2/5/15 was exactly opposite. Probably the most uncomfortable easyjet flight we've ever had (A319). Had seats 20 E & F which were extremely cramped. Luckily the flight left almost on time but with an extended flight time due to head winds it was the best part of two hours of purgatory. This won't stop us using easyjet but we'll make sure we don't have these seats again. Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly but you don't expect them to be your new best friends.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Our first time travelling with EasyJet. We had a slight confusion with a staff member at the baggage drop as after he'd weighed and labelled my case I mentioned that the case was my hand luggage but he didn't understand what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but the confusion could have been avoided if there were signs up at both Bristol and Reykjavik airports telling people with just hand luggage that they don't need to go to baggage drop but can proceed to wherever the next step is. Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink. Refreshments expensive especially crisps and chocolate but the bacon baguette I had on the outward flight was tasty! Overall the flights weren't as bad as I'd feared from their reputation and I would probably fly EasyJet again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Although they said that I would need to put my handbag into my suitcase because ""only one piece is allowed"" but this woman in front of me had several bags from duty free shops which were quite a bit larger than my handbag yet they said nothing about them to her. Additionally I'm not sure if the seats were not meant to recline or I just couldn't find the switch but I ended up not being able to recline the seat on the flight which was fine for a short flight but for further destinations I think this probably wouldn't be comfortable.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It was a traditional 'sardine tin' flight with no leg room and the aisle armrest didn't go up so it was very difficult getting in and out without holding the headrest of the seat in front where a poor young man attempting to sleep was continuously disturbed by me getting up and down as we had a baby with us who wouldn't sit still and it was a 7 30am flight. However the return journey was a total surprise we were on a newer plane with lots of leg room the aisle arm rest went up so we had lots of space and I didn't need to hold onto anything to get in and out of my seat. The seats were a lot thinner but surprisingly more comfortable than the previous thicker seats. On both journeys the planes were on time the staff were friendly- more on the outward flight 2 of the flight attendants on the way back obviously had lost the ability to smile so overall my first experience with easy jet was a positive one and I would definitely use them again.

Delayed by 30 minutes due to what seems a terrible lack of organization at easyjet's hub in Lisbon's airport terminal 2. There were 3 flights of easyjet leaving all at the same time. This terminal consists in a suffocating atmosphere with considerably bad infrastructure and used only for departures of low cost airlines. I was assigned a seat at the last row of the plane and not only there wasn't no window - in what it seems a business measure to book the more possible passengers at the expense of the seat pitch - but the plane itself was a really old A319 very degraded but the worst was the total lack of cleaning on the plane the seats textiles had a vivid brown in an absolutely act of negligence. The Portuguese male flight attendants chat a lot between both of them loud and clear as if the passengers were interested in knowing about their lives. Easyjet tends to be an excellent alternative choice but this time failed low of expectations. And please stop selling cameras among others throughout the flight. It seems like a bazaar not a plane.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Not sure what the point of the baggage drop is when you have to join an endless queue with people arguing about seats and luggage. The check in at Marrakech airport was farcical. We joined a queue with 4 families ahead of us. There was already a woman at the counter who kept arguing with the counter staff for over half an hour. The checking clerk kept disappearing and nothing appeared to be resolved. Then a single-man checked in quickly. He was followed by a large family group who appeared to be completely unable to fill in there own exit cards. The check clerk proceeded to fill in each form for them taking over half an hour! The family then proceeded to tag each piece of luggage with security strips. Our conclusion is you need to arrive 3 hours before the flight in order check in. We were most disappointed.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We had a few friends telling us about delays problems getting into the plane and lack of information. We've always been happy with the service travelling with our family but have been disappointed by our last trip from Barcelona to London Gatwick. Our flight was scheduled at 7.30 pm. We had not luggage so arrived at the airport at 6pm. No information on the gate was available - we then learned that the flight was delayed by one hour. No one on the ground had information to give us. Delayed by another hour. We finally get to Gatwick and we were delayed again because there were no ground staff. Don't they have people at Gatwick who are supposed to communicated with the airport staff. Not a great experience.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

One of the passengers arrived separately from the rest of us. He processed to easyjet check-in desk to get a boarding pass and was given the wrong boarding pass by the staff member. He never checked the boarding pass and managed to clear security at the airport with it. When the remanding 3 passengers tried to clear security with our boarding pass this was then it was discovered that the boarding passes were mixed up. This took sometime to be resolved but eventually did. As it was nearly time for our flight to leave we hurried to the gate only to find that is was already closed. At no point during this period did easyjet page us to advise that the gate was closing or that it was the last call for us (the passengers). We had to go back to easyjets desk in the departure area and waited over 45 minutes before someone came to the desk to see us. We had the use the phone on the desk to call an easyjet staff member 7 times before someone arrived. When someone did arrive the matter was not handled with any urgency. We were taken back to customer service desk and were told that it is our responsibility to get to the get to the gate on time. In order to change the ticket we would need to pay. We advised them of the error made my easyjet staff of giving the wrong boarding pass to the wrong passenger. We also asked why we were not paged and was told that easyjet doesn't page customers. They will only do so if you have checked in a bag. We did not check in any bags as we were only going to jersey for a day. I told the agent it was discrimination as easyjet assumes that all passengers are literate. Also it is common practice for airlines to page passengers if they have checked in and not arrived at the gate. We were offered the next easyjet flight which was in the afternoon at nearly 4pm which meant our day trip would not happen. Tried phoning customer service and we were meet with the same no help attitude. In the end we when to jersy and was only able to spend 2 hours. A very unsatisfactory trip. Since then trying to get customer service to take some action has been terrible.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern Scotland. Flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to Tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. At check-in we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyJet would try to push the flight forward. The opposite happened. Our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. Eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. Staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. There were no easyJet representatives to speak to only gate staff. When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Ushered through to the bridge but then waited 15 minutes on staircase as they won't pay to use the full bridge service. Arrived a bit late at Gatwick but to South Terminal. Fine for me as I was alone and catching the train but a real pain for anyone expecting to be met at the North Terminal. And not a word from the cabin crew and no ground crew to offer any apology or explanation. Not good enough. And when comparing prices worth noting that the drinks and snacks I had free on BA the week before would have cost £13 on Easyjet.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Return flight also excellent with a good crew but information in main lounge was poor regarding gate and boarding.

What a mess! When we arrived at the bag drop there were two long queues moving rather slowly. EasyJet staff was running madly around the queues calling out for the passengers of the flights that are about to depart. These passengers (us among them) were then moved from inside the general queues to the fast track queue. The bag drop person informed us that the flight was delayed by 1 hour (this information never appeared on the airport display). We figured we had enough time to have a quick lunch. While waiting for our food I went to the information booth to double-check where the lady told me that our flight is not really being delayed all that much maybe by 1/2 hour or less - still no update on any of the airport displays. We quickly bagged our lunch and rushed to the gate. There was still no plane at the gate. Eventually it arrived late (the airport display still had the original departure time no update) and the boarding began. What a mess! After the initial boarding call for privileged EasyJet loyalty program members general boarding call was announced without any regard to the row numbers (i.e. everyone entered in random order) - but the airplane door was closed for some reason so after standing for a while in the line many people went back to the waiting area. Finally the door was open and everyone went inside the plane. Because the boarding order was not related in any way to the location of the people inside the aircraft (normally the rear rows board first to avoid congestion) chaos inside the aircraft followed and the boarding itself took a long time. The flight itself was uneventful no problems upon arrival luggage was offloaded quickly. If this airline can introduce some order into its operational activities I will be happy to use its services again. Also our flight may have been an exception - I do realize that one should not generalize based on a single flight experience.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

It seems that Easyjet have now employed the Gestapo that Ryanair used to employ to monitor cabin luggage. The Southend boarding staff are rude. My wife and I both had small cabin luggage and straw hats in separate plastic bags. Yes I know Easyjet have a one bag policy which we knew about before we flew but please tell me why Easyjet requires customers to take the hat out of a see-through bag and put it on rather than employ common sense. I suppose we must wait for Easyjet to adopt the same cabin baggage policy that Ryanair has been forced to adopt (ie. you are allowed a personal item). Previously we have ranked Easyjet higher than Ryanair. After two recent flights with Ryanair over the last couple of months I think we will now stick with Ryanair and avoid Easyjet. Thankfully Easyjet staff at Faro do not apply Easyjet's ridiculous rules.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Flight from Gatwick to Prague in late August. We followed the rules about bag dimensions and weights and checked in 1 bag each and proceeded to the holding area. Finally a call that our flight was boarding and an extended stampede of passengers to Gate 25 only to find we were further held before boarding. Here we were met with a very unfriendly ground staff member telling us that we were only allowed 1 bag not 2 as we were carrying (1 x wheelie + 1 x accessories). Having checked with the EZ web site just 10 days earlier which clearly indicates that a conforming carry on bag and an additional accessories bag was acceptable my wife and I found ourselves along with plenty of other passengers in a difficult space trying to squeeze our accessories bags into a single carry on. Having got into the plane that was about 2/3 full the PA system was telling us that small bags should be stowed under the seats in front of us. Clearly the people at EZ have no idea about presenting a uniform message. In my case 3 different messages. Does the left hand really know what the right hand is doing? A further delay occurred when the ground staff wouldn't issue a receipt for GBP 45 for an unfortunate passenger who couldn't squeeze 2 into 1 and it had to go in the hold. Rightly she refused to board the plane until a receipt was provided which saw us with a departure delay of around 30 minutes. The aircrew seemed more interested in themselves than providing a customer focused service.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Naturally being an airline of it's type anything you want onboard bar the toilet is chargable. Not a problem as what's on offer is priced reasonably the selection being good and if it's hot food you're purchasing it comes to you hot not lukewarm. Cabin crew seem to be far more visible during the flight than on some airlines which is undoubtedly a positive. Whilst no one expects them trolling the aisles for the who flight it is great to see them other than during cabin preparation and service times. Definitely an airline I'd have no hesitation in recommending. Comfortable on time flight priced competitively clean and comfortable cabin. Wishful thinking would have me hope some of the national airlines would embrace some of easyjets best practices but that will never happen so easyjet where practicable and price dependant would always be my first choice.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers! We told a crew member and he said ""Well I'm not checking the bag sizes."" No customer courtesy! Next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didn't choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. My grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. We asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. Not one bit of sympathy! The man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window! No courtesy from the staff! No help! Outrageously not allowing our bag on because of the wheel being 2 centimetres too long when bigger bags we saw were allowed on!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Onward flight delayed half an hour but no big issue as I was travelling for leisure and Hamburg was my final destination. Plane reasonably clean and comfortable crew friendly even if not as professional as you would expect them to be (often making jokes and laugh among themselves). Seat assignment worked fine so the boarding was smooth even though a bit slow both ways as they start to queue people at the gate well in advance. The best things were price and schedule which is what makes you choose a low cost carrier at the end. I often fly Ryanair as they are based in Bergamo where I live and work and it had been a long time (8 years) since I last flew with Easyjet: this experience was ok and I will still consider them as an option for future trips.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

What's the point? 2) Those passengers who do pay extra to check in their hold baggage are only discriminated once on board. The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew. Pity the magazines were stained torn pages missing and out of date. Basic service. If you can't be bothered replacing them please don't have them in the seat pocket. I gave up looking for the 'menu' because the magazines were filthy. 4) Sorry bring back full service airlines.

The return journey on July 18th left right on time but on landing was assigned a parking space in the international section of the airport. This entailed a walk to a bus to enable passengers to get to baggage claim. Of course with my wife requiring wheelchair assistance we were kept on the plane till an ""ambulance"" vehicle arrived to take us to baggage claim.

Actually in Berlin and Pisa they announce ""boarding"" while the plane is not actually there put all the passengers in the small room with no fresh air and place to seat. Above mentioned airports are very small and look like hangars. Easyjet writes that the boarding ends 30 minutes before flight while actually it opens 30 minutes before or sometimes even later!.

We decided to make our way to the airport anyway and once there joined a queue of other confused passengers. Anyway to cut a long story short we were put in a 4* Marriott Hotel full board for an additional 3 nights at no cost to ourselves. We had agreed to take the Gatwick flight back on the Saturday as this was the only flight available but on reaching the airport early we asked if there might be any chance that there were places on the Bristol flight.

Next time I will spend the extra money and save all the headache and hassle! 1.5+ hour wait at Rome airport just to drop the baggage. There were around 500 people in line and only 2 agents working. When the staff was questioned about additional agents they said they did not expect these numbers! Like they didn't know how many tickets they had booked for the day? Those passengers who had close departing flights were given priority so those of us who had arrived at the airport in appropriate time were made to wait even longer. After this fiasco we were informed our flight was 2+ hours delayed but we had to wait at the gate the entire time in case they decided to take off earlier. Completely unorganized and uninformed every time I use this discount airline I pay with patience. Flying out of London last year was the same story - ridiculous wait times just to drop the baggage.

Four of us coming home from Portugal last week missed breakfast as we left the hotel too early but then our transport to the airport was 40 mins late anyway this meant we only had time to check in and go straight to the boarding area for the plane which meant we were all ravenous by the time we boarded!

The catering on the flight from Portugal to Liverpool ran out of warm food and other popular items less than a quarter of the way along the plane. The gift selection suffered much the same fate because we were informed the outward flight from Liverpool to Portugal was busy and had used up the supplies.

By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg. I hope these uncomfortable seats do not become standard in the future.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Service during the flight was great announcements were adequate and we landed ahead of time in Hurghada. I am 6ft 5ins and found leg room to be fine.

Luggage issues: they do have some conflicting issues depending where you are ie: only I piece of hand luggage. Then people get on with bags. Does make me laugh. As for the new size I have noted they all stay in the cabin and the larger ones moved to hold at no cost. Speedy boarding I use all the time and it works well.

All hand luggage was allowed on the plane even if it did not fit the 'new' standard size. Having much smaller bags meant that we had to have 2 pieces under the seat so that they could fit 1 non guaranteed bag on the overhead locker. You are positively discriminated for taking a bag that is smaller that the new guaranteed size. Next time I fly I will be taking my usual size bag as this will end up in the overhead locker and I will get my leg space. No checks on the size of the luggage was performed at time of boarding.

Legroom terrible but that's the disadvantage of LC-flying. The only one. Efficient friendly crew good information from the cockpit and swift bagdrop both ways.

This is a real help to people who are a little jittery on planes. Seats are reasonably comfortable for a trip under 3 hours - any more and it would start to become an issue. Being able to pre-book a seat on Easyjet is a major step up from the free-for-all chaos of a couple of years ago. The charges for hold luggage are excessive but then this is an airline designed with city breaks in mind so hand luggage should accommodate most people's needs. No in-flight entertainment but don't most people revert to their phones / laptops / tablets these days anyway? Onboard food and drink are pricey but not ridiculously expensive and perfectly adequate compared to some of the muck served by other airlines.

The bags contained our computers wallets money tickets and other valuable items. These bags were not lockable as we expected to have them with us. Their size has been acceptable on dozens of other flights with Easyjet and other airlines as they are made to fit within the airline in cabin sizing. The excuse for this 'new' ruling was that the flight was full. Every flight that I have been on with Easyjet has been full! They need to address the issue of passengers taking oversize bags onto the aircraft without penalising those of us who always ensure we have the correct size and weight for cabin bags.

Although I am a frequent flyer I did manage to go to the wrong terminal. My fault but the fact that easyJet operate from both terminals at Gatwick is unusual and they should do more to point this out to people before they join the long bag drop queue in South terminal. Fair enough the queues move fast and staff call out the flights that are closing but that isn't much help to you if you are in the wrong terminal altogether. Fortunately in our case we realised our error quickly and we got to north terminal and made our flight but I would argue that the bag drop system needs serious improvement. The actual flight was ok but the seat pitch is unacceptable for such a long flight. It is ok to read but not enough to work on a laptop - this is an issue for business travellers. The only good thing about easyjet is the coffee which is much better than their competitors. The allocated seating is also an improvement but we were allocated seats across the aisle from one another not ideal. I would say easyjet have some way to go before they can say they are really competing with BA etc for business travellers. They need to seriously look at what Norwegian are doing.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Both flights were early so full marks. We've being using EJ since its inception and I think it is now almost on par with BA. These flights were good and the introduction of allocated seating has been a vast improvement. Check-in at Bristol was fast but BCN is still a bit of a wait (always has been -30 minutes this time). Still some room for improvement though. Hand luggage storage is a shambles and £2-50 for a cup of tea is scandalous (but you don't have buy). Prices also seem to have risen dramatically but EJ is still the best of the low cost carriers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have returned from a lovely holiday from Portugal today-the flight was slightly delayed due to Air Traffic Control problems in France but this did not affect my experience in the slightest. When it came time to start descent (which I was not aware of) one of the cabin crew tapped me on the shoulder to ask me to put my earphones and phone away on which I was watching a movie. I put everything away in double quick time as soon as I was asked and pushed my bag under the seat in front. As she walked off behind me I heard her comment to either a colleague or another passenger ""there's always one"". I was very annoyed by this and advised one of her colleagues on the way off the plane. I deliberately hung back until most of the passengers had got off so that I did not cause a scene and I deliberately did not go to the woman in question so that it did not get out if hand. The other lady assured me that they have a debrief after every flight and that my comments would be discussed. The whole point of putting the headphones in and watching the movie was for me not to disturb anyone and cabin noise not to disturb me so I was not being ignorant. However her colleagues response to my comment was very professional and reassuring.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My first trip with Easyjet and I will admit to a sense of trepidation using a budget airline with a bit of a reputation! Carry-on only so I did not have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag. I also used the speedy-board option which avoided the one gripe I would have: people boarded the plane from both front and rear but without any consideration to seat allocation meaning that people were trying to pass each other in the aisle with bags in hand - close to mayhem. Seats were comfortable and legroom good (I'm a reasonably tall person) flight attendants very friendly and helpful. In summary I was pleasantly surprised.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Outbound was on an older type aircraft the usual bulky seats meaning smaller seat pitch leg- room etc. however still perfectly bearable for the cheap cost and for the short trip. The return flight however was excellent! It must have been a newer aircraft or newer designed interior many passengers were commenting on it. Thinner seat backs and everything more streamlined made for a much more spacious seat pitch and a more comfortable journey. We could not fault it at all. We have never had any problems with Easyjet airport or aircraft staff and we wonder if any negative reviews towards staff are actually 'Easyjet' staff and not in fact the airport staff from the airport they are departing from and therefore nothing to do with Easyjet? We really cannot understand the reviews on here with regards to luggage. Easyjet (along with all airlines including Low- cost) clearly state their hold and hand luggage policy. If you choose to exceed (or ignore) these policies then expect to be challenged or charged (if you aren't then happy days).","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

No one was asked to put bag into bag sizer or indeed no check in staff even bothered to look over the counter. My issue I have with this is apart from stupidly paying for a suitcase when I could easily as it turns out take into the cabin but I was also refused to put my bag into the overhead lockers as they ""have to accommodate the larger cases""! My shoulder bag was the proper size for the flight but as it turns out it was too small. I was told that I had to put it on the floor along with my coat (it was too tall to fit under the seat in front) I had a very uncomfortable 3hrs unable to move my legs the crew member was extremely rude and didn't care about the discomfort. Surely the airlines need to have an idea of the weight of the luggage on board an aircraft? At Newcastle there was virtually no hold baggage apart from ours. If we had been the last on the flight I could understand it if there was no space in the lockers but I was on fairly early in the queue the cases overhead were crammed and one of them was taped closed obviously previously overloaded?","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Online booking:–Easyjet have a very user friendly website and their email communication was superb. Baggage charge: I found the £18 charge for a small bag to be outrageous. Bag Drop: the bag drop was straightforward and the staff member efficient but unsmiling and not at all friendly. Boarding: orderly enough but the announcements were not very clear and I saw 2 elderly people struggle unaided. The cabin crew were not at all friendly and seemed disorganised too. One member of the cabin crew was particularly unfriendly and gruff in the way in which he interacted with a young mum and a baby. Later in the flight I bought a coffee and the same man who was rude to the lady with the baby handed me my change with a phoney smile and the money with a strange expression. I checked the change and saw that rather than a £2 coin he had handed me an Arabic coin. I immediately saw this and asked for the correct coinage. It took the efforts of two of his colleagues for me to receive the correct change and no apology. Announcements: there were very few announcements during this journey and no route map at all. The lady captain made one announcement at the end of the flight. Comfort: The seat was rather thin but comfortable enough for the distance flown. Value: the price I paid was quite reasonable. However this was not the cheapest on this route and so I shall shop around in future to make sure I get a good deal.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Did not notice any particular problems except the boarding process in Berlin. The part B of the airport from which Easyjet flights depart looks like a hangar with no ventilation and places to sit. There is a huge line for boarding moving very slow. They started boarding before the plane arrived and all the passengers had to wait in very small room overheated with no fresh air. Also they write that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure while in reality it only starts at this time or even later. I guess that is completely unacceptable even for a low-cost.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have to say that I'm pretty happy with it. You pay for what you get. The passengers usually are rude and the seats are tight but for short trips it is ok. I had a big delay once (5+ hours) but normally it leaves on time or with minor delays. I never checked in luggage therefore I can't review that part. I also never eat/drink on board so I don't understand the complaints of many about that. It is an airline not a restaurant! Eat at the aiport if you must!

To read the easyjet web site this sounds like a casual walk in the park. It is not. Departing Gatwick we were in a zig zag for 50 minutes with the staff constantly going up and down pulling out passengers who were likely to miss their flight thereby pushing the rest of us back in the queue. However worse was to come on the return leg from Copenhagen when we were in a 60 minute baggage drop queue due to there being just one desk open - easyjet will not pay for more. On this showing just what is the difference between check in and baggage drop.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Only gripe is that Easyjet are not as flexible with hand-luggage as they used to be it's a strict one bag per person rule meaning handbags sandwich bags etc must go in your hand-luggage.

The flight itself was not bad and the staff were good. LGW staff were attentive and helpful. LGW location and time good. I have no complaints about staff or aeroplane. It's the in-flight offering. Paying £7 for a cheese and ham roll and a coffee is a rip-off. Worse is booking online. The fact the flight was advertised at £76 then plus plus plus. £76 becomes £125 and then the most annoying part of all having to pay to reserve your seat knowing if you don't you're going to have a lot of trouble at the airport. I wished I had booked British Airways. At 6'3"" I don't have a choice and by the time the online system permitted me to book the tall persons seats had gone because there is unclear notification on the website that you have to pay additional cash to book your seat if you're checking-in online. Next time I'll get up early and fly BA. Advertised Flight £76. Actual cost with hidden extras £140.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Great airline easy to use and if flying anywhere in Europe always use easyjet. We flew Bristol to Alicante in October and as with all our previous easyjet flights we were on time clean aircraft comfortable and the cabin crew are as good as Virgin Atlantic. Obviously as a ""no frill's"" airline you don't get ""free food"" or films etc but that said you don't pay for it either and if you want to eat there is good choice on board and for a couple of hours you don't need much anyway. Basically if we are flying to Europe we always fly easyjet.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My husband forgot to print off the boarding pass until the last minute so our seats were not ideal especially on the return! Right at the back of the plane by the loo. However allocated seating is still a vast improvement on the horrible scrum you got before. We got to the airport on our return quite early and consequently were near the front of the queue. It was all quite friendly until a 'lady' who had booked speedy boarding turned up. She started shouting that they were all in the wrong queue. We checked in at the normal queue sailed past her and relaxed on the terrace for quite a while. On our return we got our bags first. Moral of the story there is absolutely no point in paying extra for speedy boarding!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My first time with Easyjet for 5 years having avoided low-cost carriers since then due to several bad experiences. But I cannot believe the difference - Easyjet now beats the full-service carriers not only on cost but on most other aspects as well. Paying to choose seats makes a huge difference but it's not just that - the whole experience was so good on both sectors that I had to keep reminding myself that I was not flying with a flag-carrier. Friendly helpful professional and good-humoured crew on both flights flights on time no baggage/boarding card issues and seat pitch slightly better than expected (but you will struggle if you're over 5'11"" I'll admit). Warm food available too - which was surprising. I've flown with 5 different airlines this year and only the flights with Qatar were better than this. I'm planning on flying this route again very soon and Easyjet will definitely be the first choice next time.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Efficient check-in and on-time departures at both ends which is good and indeed better than some. I am fed-up with their baggage policy. We paid extra for our case to go in the hold but was then asked to remove our coats from the overhead storage compartments so that other people's huge hand luggage could have the space! Baggage in the cabin is becoming a joke (a couple with a small toddler loaded 3 cases!) but we were asked to put our coats on the dirty floor or sit through the entire flight baking hot with them on our laps - not sure how we were expected to eat or drink anything in comfort as the table could barely be deployed! The overhead storage area was choc-a-block so I wonder if our group had also taken cases to go in the cabin - where on earth would it have been put! Maybe next time we won't pay extra and just wait for them to put the overload/surplus in the hold anyway unless of course they ask us to put it on our laps! Easyjet have a good pricing structure and if they included a piece of hold baggage as standard (and enforced the one piece of 'hand' luggage they could become an airline to seriously challenge their flag flying rivals.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Luton airport's small terminal resembled a crowded low-end shopping mall with a large food court. The passenger security check was well-managed. There was little seating in the almost-windowless departure lounge though there was somewhere to buy a coffee amid the duty free gauntlet. You wouldn't want to be delayed here. The walk from terminal entrance to boarding gate was relatively short as was the quick taxi from aircraft parking stand to take-off. At the boarding gate (gate 16) many passengers crowded precariously for at least 10 or 15 minutes over the entire length of a long and steep stairway with their cabin baggage before being able to access a small ground-level room where passports and boarding cards were slowly checked before exiting into the open air to walk across the tarmac to board the plane parked nearby. My single carry-on bag complied exactly with the airline's specified 56 x 45 x 25cm maximum dimensions including handles and wheels. At the boarding gate a member of Easyjet staff selected passengers with wheeled bags from the queue for baggage assessment. My bag did not quite fit a metal- framed gauge indicating that it was over-sized. I was required to check it in and pay a £40 fee on the spot. Not negotiable. The gate staff were blunt unsympathetic and appeared hardened to this procedure which felt like a scam. I still had to carry the bag to the aircraft steps and locate a hold-baggage loader to accept it. After boarding had finished there was ample empty space in the overhead lockers for my regulation-size cabin bag. Admittedly my soft- shell Samsonite wheelie was full which may have distorted the dimensions slightly but Easyjet's exacting customer- unfriendly approach felt 'out to get'. Be warned! On the return flight from Olbia my bag - the very same bag - just fitted a similar gauge and I was allowed to take it in the cabin. On both flights the cabins were tidy but with grubby carpet. There was no choice of seat (unless you opted to pay more in advance) which was randomly allocated at the time of online check in. The seat pitch was very tight though just tolerable for a two-hour flight; not for anything longer. The cabin crew both outbound and inbound were friendly and efficient but did nothing to stop noisy young children from running up and down the aisle throughout the entire flight and also made too many announcements. The announcements promoting food and tax-free sales and so many price-savings were intrusive and relentless. Pity the Easyjet frequent-flier! There was no complimentary in-flight catering but drinks and some over-priced unhealthy snacks were offered for sale. The outbound flight departed from Luton on time and arrived a few minutes early in Olbia. The return flight began boarding on time in Olbia but departed 30 minutes late. This delay appeared to be due to desperately inefficient ground handling staff at the boarding gate in Olbia who seemed to lack any sense of interest in getting the flight away on time. We made up some time during the journey and landed 20 minutes late into Gatwick. We arrived at Gatwick North terminal though the flight was sold as arriving at Gatwick South terminal. The boarding pass also indicated arrival at Gatwick South terminal. No announcement as to the change of terminal was made by the crew and anyone unfamiliar with Gatwick airport would have been unaware. The potential for this anomaly to cause problems for customers with pick-up arrangements is obvious. Overall Easyjet was a third-rate airline experience. Bare minimum transportation for a full-service price and the feeling of having been ripped-off.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I fly them I know exactly what to expect for the money I pay and I stick to their baggage regulations which look more than ""spartan"". To be honest I got what I wanted boarding on time landing on time seats comfortable and the prices for beverages were definitely lower then those at the airport. They look like a very good alternative to the not-low-cost airlines which are expensive and do not worth the money. I will fly them often for short trips in Europe and small vacations around the continent. Their business model seems to make a difference since they are expanding their network all the time. Looking forward to see what they can do.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I was disappointed with their lack of helpfulness and customer services considering my previous experience with them were mostly good. On the return flight our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours Easyjet gave us £3 voucher each which was even insufficient to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee in an expensive airport likes KEF.

For a vacation it will make you stressed that you paid 50 euros in additional fees there and 50 euros in additional fees back. For a business trip it will make you uncomfortable for the rest of your journey abroad knowing that you had no space to breathe and sat in a poorly-maintained aircraft as transportation. It was my first time flying easyJet and definitely my last. Listen to the reviews above because these are true stories and I just experienced a common negative review above. EasyJet forced me to check my bag in for 50 euros one-way at the gate even though I have taken this bag every time I travel as a carry on. The surprise fees at the gate were more expensive than my ticket. Don't let the low prices online fool you.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We were told 20 minutes into the flight that we had a problem with the engines that we had to turn round and land back at Luton. On arrival the engineers came over to the aircraft and we were told that the problem could not be fixed so we were off loaded and went back into the airport terminal. We were given a voucher for £3 per person and we went back into the departure lounge. Easyjet flew a replacement aircraft from London Gatwick and we took off 5.5 hours late. Now a few points: there were people moaning and groaning the usual but I cannot praise Easyjet enough. Onboard the aircraft before we were off loaded the pilot kept us informed and invited us to the cockpit to ask any questions we had. The logistics off replacing that aircraft from another airport was I thought brilliant. The service was brilliant on board. The return journey was fabulous and the crew were brilliant as well and I have great respect for Easyjet and enjoy flying with them and they have no comparisons with any other low cost carrier. And another thing on return we had an email from customer service apologising about the delay.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Despite having checked in online (after having virtually been harassed to do so) we encountered a massive queue at the bag drop in Rome. Way too many passengers and way too few open desks. With our flight nearing the cut off we wouldn't have made it if they hadn't called us over to another counter - a blink- and-you'll-miss-it announcement. With boarding starting in ten minutes desk staff was not even able to tell us our boarding gate. Having made it there boarding was slow and confusing with no announcements made of any kind. We were bussed to the plane but could only board through the front door which slowed things down even more. Flight was uneventful staff was polite but not especially friendly. All in all the only positive aspect of this flight was the fare. Everything else just showed that this airline is operating on the cheap and isn't even trying to hide it.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Family of four. I was quite wary of booking with EasyJet for a mid length flight but the experience was absolutely fine. Check in and boarding was simple. Staff both ends were friendly and efficient. There were a lot of Russians on the flights but EasyJet have employed some English speaking Russian flight attendants to handle them. Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings. Even with the food added to the ticket price costs were less than half of a comparable flight with other airlines. Maybe on a longer flight I would yearn for an in flight movie and some free drink but if I go back to Moscow I will use EasyJet.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through ""manually"" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Hand baggage only and checked in on my iPhone the app was very easy to use. There was a little confusion at the gate about which queue was what (i.e. Speed Boarding and the Other Queue) however announcements were made to clarify the confusion. One bag policy was an irritation (as was their militant- style checks of it) given that Monarch have now relaxed this as long as both bags fit within the allowance. Very warm welcome onboard by the crew. Seating tight but not too uncomfortable for a short flight - wouldn't fly with them mid-haul in those seats however. Allocated seating is a great improvement although there is still a mad rush to board for locker space. A fear seems to exist on low cost carriers in regards to this but I don't find this same mad rush on BA flights (when passengers tend to carry even more hand luggage). Selection of food and drink very extensive. Not too many announcements and no pushy sales. Service very warm and friendly. On time arrival and quick disembarkation. If easyJet can get smooth out the last remaining 'low cost feel' ruffles from their product (issues with hand luggage and more options to pay extra for space i.e. a blocked middle seat) I would consider them on par with BA 's product in Europe. easyJet have come a long way and overall I was quite pleased with the journey experience.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I had to catch a connecting flight between Lisbon and Madrid. The flight to Madrid a short travel of 45/50 minutes arrived on scheduled to Madrid so I had a stopover there of about 4 hours. I didn't have problems with the luggage. The boarding was a bit confusing (due to speedy boarding) and the flight was full so the experience on the ground and on board was poor. The space between the seats was also very short a thing that is normal on these low cost companies. My returning flight was threatened by a ground strike on Barajas. Even though the flight was delayed 1hr 20 minutes the crews kept passengers informed. I'll choose this low cost option to travel between European countries.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They will not allow you to put anything under the seat in front of you so your purse is your carry-on and they'll charge you to check what should be your carry-on bag. Most European rollers are smaller than U.S. ones so your roller won't work. Our first flight from Brussels to Berlin cost us 50 euros extra when they took my roller at the gate. My husbands roller was allowed. On the second easy jet flight from Berlin to Paris we paid the counter charge of 30 euro for my roller only to have my husbands roller denied at the security line adjacent (literally) to the ticket counter for which we paid another gate fee of 50 euro even though we hadn't left the lobby. While in the security line a woman on our flight was worried about the time. She said ""I know this airline and if you're not at the gate a half hour before departure they will deny you boarding"". So we begged ourselves to the front of the line and ran to the gate. At least in Brussels they were calling people up on a flight that was next to depart. If you are under 25 and making a short trip then take easy jet. If you are an American on an extensive trip avoid them. What you save in air fare is not worth the fees you will pay at the airport. I will say the inflight crews were very nice.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Historically I have been a fan and supporter of EZY but this was my first long flight with the airline and taught me that the business model translates very badly to longer stage lengths - I don't expect a hot meal and free newspapers - my flight was a nightmare due to a simple collision of demographics. The two passengers behind me were incredibly badly behaved obviously drunk when they boarded and the cabin crew served them each two Stellas and 6 double G&Ts. Cabin crew on commission are never going to not serve someone another round of drinks. These particular passengers made everyone around them's flight absolutely miserable. I don't even mind a bit of bad behaviour on a short flight going to EDI or HAM or somewhere it can even be a source of comedy but on a 4+ hour night flight I and my neighbours should not expect to have our seats kicked deliberately and be sworn at. I will fly EZY again on short haul but over about 2hrs the risk is simply too great of being mixed in with people who don't know how to behave and are in no fit state to fly. The 20 minute delay on the taxiway after landing and parking at the“wrong”terminal (South instead of North) because they wanted the aircraft parked at the South terminal for the first flight out the next morning caused a lot of inconvenience and was a final twist of the knife to finish off a horrible experience.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

There is no consistency in this requirement and until you arrive at the gate no clear advice. So you seat on an aircraft with no money to buy refreshments no accessible passport and none of the other items that make a flight more bearable. It is humiliating to have your boarding pass confiscated while you struggle to put your handbag (even a small one) into an already full very small cabin bag while other people sail past you with their duty free bottles of wine clanging merrily away.

Always surprised by their baggage policy. I was just 1 kg over (21 kgs) and the check in assistant charged me. It's not a problem but I was just thinking the person in front of me weighed at least 95 kgs and is not charged for their 20kg bag. I weigh 65 kgs and have to pay for 1 kg over. Appreciate you cannot charge based on a person's total weight but for some reason it seems unfair. Also they are not very consistent - I often carry 21 kgs on Easyjet and they do not charge anything - could depend on the mood of the Easyjet check in assistants. At Luton the assistant said the Managers had asked them to charge every person on that day.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Cabin crew exceptionally pleasant and friendly. On time departure from HAM and early arrival into EDI on the way back. Cabin crew not up to the same standard as the earlier crew but still fine.

They were also very professional. The seats are comfortable with good legroom although if you have longer legs you may want to upgrade to the exit row seats. There is also a wide range of items to buy as gifts at good prices which we took advantage of. The aircraft (same both ways) was in excellent condition and very clean; the flights both left on time and arrived at the destination early. Only had hand luggage and what was interesting in how quite a few people seem to have massive bags as hand luggage Easyjet were very lenient in not enforcing the rule a certain other airline would have made a fortune in oversized baggage!

Plane was delayed 2 hours due to a technical fault. However staff were most professional and pleasant they kept us informed and entertained. The plane was spotlessly clean. Our return was also simple and easy with no hitches whatsoever. The airport was organised and calm (unlike Air Malta) We have given up on speedy boarding as with pre booked seats I don't feel there is a need for it.

There was no scrum at the boarding gate as everyone knew where they were sitting thanks to Easyjet's new allocated seating. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient and landed in Barcelona 20 minutes early. Return flight back to Southend was practically the same as the inbound flight quick bag drop queue and security in Barcelona Terminal 2C. This time we were bussed from the gate to the aircraft which was orderly and no scrum. We even had the same cabin manager on this flight as we did on the outbound flight.

Ticket purchase fairly easy online but printing the boarding pass and online check-in could be made simpler. Due to the early departure I checked my luggage in the night before. Arrived the next morning and saw that at 5.30am they were still full. Shocked that at security at Gatwick I went straight to an x-ray machine! No queues! Eateries rammed as it was the start of the school holidays. Gate announced on time. At the gate they called all those with reserved seats and speedy boarding first. Told to go to the front of the bus and cram in there. Non-priority pax got on the same bus. Longest journey to the plane round the back of the airport and across most of it. At the plane the driver opened only the front door so speedy pax could exit first but as easyJet allocates seats you don't get the disgusting crush and rush as you do on Ryanair. Clean cabin. Thanked by the captain for boarding quickly but then told that the flight was to be delayed due to Air Traffic Control not giving them a slot until 2hrs later! I missed my connecting ferry. Captain came on and said the slot had been pushed back even further to 10am. Crew came down with free water a couple of times. Eventually take off 2 hours late. Fairly uncomfortable for a long flight when you add the extra time on the ground in. Crew were very cheery and professional. The chicken wrap I got had limited fillings and was very dry. The box of crisps were over salty and very oily. Next time I'll buy something at the airport to bring on board. Arriving at Kefalonia we were behind another flight so had to wait to clear immigration a bit and for our bags to arrive. Mine was the last one off! Easyjet are preferable to Ryanair and in some respects to the charter airlines that fly this route so I'd probably fly them again unless the old BMI charter flies again under BA colours.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I was especially impressed with the way they took the time to engage with my young children on both flights. On our return flight the air con was producing vapour during take off due to it being so hot outside and the crew made a special announcement just to reassure passengers as some were concerned it was smoke. The captain also warned us to expect turbulence just after take off and took time to explain why it may occur. Whilst seating is rather tight it is no worse than many other airlines and the service is far superior to that of many major scheduled airlines. Snacks and drinks are not badly priced and the coffee is pretty good which is more than can be said for other airlines I have flown with recently.

So I went online to check the flight status and it still said ""on time"". I went down to the Easyjet counter on the ground floor to report this (politely at first) and was met by a miserable woman who brushed me off. When I (still politely) persisted she simply ignored me. I then told her (not very politely) that I would report the matter to Easyjet to which she replied she did not work for Easyjet but for another company contracted by Easyjet to handle enquiries! What a nonsense. The flight itself eventually left some time later and arrived without incident. But I made a full report of my experience with their staff at Bristol Airport known to them in writing for which I received an grudging apology.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

They took the people with priority boarding outside on a mini bus 25 min before the aircraft was ready and they left us in the mini bus under the sun with broken air conditioning.

Like the outbound journey a week before baggage drop was far too long! Over an hour! The most frustrating thing being the Easyjet Plus desk was open and hardly being used! Also I really don't understand why on both flights I had to carry my bag across the airport to ""oversized baggage"" when it wasn't and I wasn't charged extra. In flight crew were lovely really warm and friendly. They were having problems with my card while purchasing beverages but were patient. Flight was slightly delayed on way out (airport's fault not Ryanair) but made up for time and arrived early.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Outward flight was with an easyJet Switzerland A319 which was older and was showing its age with the seat in front not being able to stay in any position apart from fully reclined. Return was on a newer A320 and the removal of the ability to recline made the flight much more comfortable. There was a huge queue at both London Gatwick and Geneva at bag drop and the boarding process is still a mess due to easyJet's new hand baggage guarantee making people rush to avoid having their bags placed in the hold. However they are still very good value for money and travelling without a hold bag would eliminate the problem with the bag drop queue.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Apart from being given a 9 euro refreshment voucher which we queued for one hour to receive after seeing a line forming there was no information from ground staff. No attempt made to find alternative flights. We spent 9 hours in Madrid airport and I received an emailed standard feedback form which allowed me 50 characters to write my comments. Ground staff were rude to passengers at both boardings shouting at passengers about their hand luggage. I was extremely unimpressed that there was such little concern for the welfare of passengers.

We arrived 2.5 hours before departure. No staff were at the bag drop before 1hr 50 mins before departure by which time there was a huge queue (back to the door of the terminal). At the beginning only two desks were manned and it took us over an hour to get to the front of the queue. However once our bags had been tagged we had to join a further huge queue with our bags to put them on a conveyor belt! The staff were rude and disinterested. Fortunately the security staff and passport control were quick and efficient and then we had to queue again to get into the gate. The gate had virtually no chairs and we ended up standing and queuing for over 2 hours. In fact the only free time we stole for ourselves was 5 minutes to go to the toilet. A truly awful experience.

When I joined the queue there were about 70 people ahead of me and only one person a young man who was doing his best and to his credit remained very calm on duty the other staff member being on the Speedy Boarding desk. The queue moved very slowly and was growing I estimated about 120 in total just before they opened a second bag drop desk about 5 minutes before I reached the front after a wait of just under 50 minutes which is completely unacceptable. This complaint is not about the staff concerned but about management who had not foreseen the staffing level required. The number of departures and passengers departing are a known quantity and as far as I am aware there was no unusual circumstance so this is just poor planning or cost saving at the expense of the customer. I travel easyJet a lot sometimes 5 or six flights a month and rarely have cause to complain.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

When we eventually boarded our flight the captain explained that they had had a troublesome customer in London who had to be removed from the aeroplane and that meant they were further delayed and missed their slot into Nice. Staff on the flight were wonderful considering they had had a long and stressful day. When we arrived at Gatwick we had missed our connection but EasyJet again came up trumps and put us up for the night free of charge in a hotel. The information desk at Gatwick had not informed us about this and it was only by chance we found out as we thought we would be spending the night on one of the airport benches!

We were in an emergency exit row with me at the window and her in the middle. After take off I slid up the window blinder as it was a day flight and I didn't want the sun in my eyes. The blinder stuck and I was unable to slide it down for landing. As we approached Venice we came within 100-200 feet of the ground then pulled up and out of the landing. The co- captain came over the speaker saying 'the pilot decided not to land and there would be more information shortly.' After another fifteen minutes of circling Italy we landed. On the way back we'd noticed that every EasyJet flight was running 15-20 minutes late and every flight had it's gate moved. Our flight went from Gate 19 to Gate 28 for example. After sitting and waiting to board we were jammed into a bus and driven out to the plane. Waiting for takeoff I turned on the air blower above the seat and the panel fell down. The attendants fixed it but that is not at all comforting as you're about to fly. On the flight home I rolled my window blinder up and it stuck again. The flights were loud the seats didn't recline. The in-flight reading had to be purchased though a catalogue of duty-free items was in the seat-back.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Easyjet are now making announcements asking passengers to volunteer to put their baggage in the hold free of charge. How can overhead lockers cope with unlimited weight? This is stupid beyond belief. You have passengers sticking 15 kilos in their hand baggage to save buying hold baggage. Did Easyjet really not see the absolutely obvious outcome of this policy. I constantly see passengers having to move items from hold baggage to hand baggage to avoid additional charges. Sort it out Easyjet.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair. I will not be looking to fly with them again any time soon if this trend continues!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The only bugbear I have is that when booking a return flight and hold baggage is required one way only you have to call Easyjet to do this as the system is not able to book one-way hold baggage. As a regular traveller with Easyjet would also be nice if they offered some sort of frequent flyer reward (rather than offering Easyjet Plus for £149/year) on similar lines to the Vantage Club with Monarch.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As far as I can see this online service is just a way for the airline to save costs and printer ink.

Boarding was chaotic at LGW with speedy board passengers sitting all over the plane and creating congestion with the non speedy board passengers. 30 mins late on take off. Crew were fine and polite. Food was just ok (at an extra charge). On return flight their web site wouldn't let me check in the hold baggage so had to call customer services from Spain who told me as I hadn't booked direct with them it could only be changed by my travel company or by phone with them. Charged £28 to ""check in"" 2 hold bags. Return: Long wait at bag drop in Fuerteventura. Check in was quite slow and boarding was chaotic. Despite handing over my pre printed boarding pass I was issued with a new one at the bag drop which rather defeats the object of the so called online service. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Plane arrived on time. Total extra charges for trip amounted to around £118 for hold baggage and food. Not good in my opinion.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

When I arrived to the airport I was charged for £25/€30 to check in my bag. Even if the website doesn't allow you to pre-book your baggage on one flight if you book a round trip (£187 + £25) it would be better to book another airline. On an anther flight I had no food and beverages on board as the service was too slow so they couldn't save me before landing. I spent 1hr 20mins with no drinks.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Only two sites were open then after about 20 minutes another two which meant that with few staff a very long queue of anxious people including myself took around 50 minutes just to drop off the luggage and although we were on time getting to the airport it only left a short time to grab a sandwich from Pret before making our way to board. I recommend at least 2.5 hours with this system so that it gives you more breathing time. Coming back via Nice Airport was a delight - they had 10 baggage drop off sites and it only took about 15 minutes - Easyjet get your act together!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Lovely modern clean plane and very friendly crew. Arrived early baggage already waiting in the arrivals area after disembarking. So efficient. Only thing that really let them down was the queuing at London Gatwick's North Terminal to drop our luggage in. We printed our boarding cards at home but still queued for almost an hour at Gatwick to check bags in. Very slow service and only 4 desks open of a possible 20. Staff were available calling customers on flights departing before ours so that was something but more staff required at bag drop for sure!

The new seat allocation process is fantastic such a massive improvement. Both flights were early taking off and landing (even allowing for the padding in the flight times). Nice plane and good flight crew and seats are comfortable enough for a 2 to 3 hour flight. EJ are now approaching BA as a premium airline.

Travelled with infant so joined speedy boarding queue on both flights. Outbound flight was ok as there were a few empty seats so that gave us a bit more room. Few gripes on the inbound flight. The first been that they ran out of hot food and virtually everything else by the time they reached us in row 17 and the second been that despite there been a number of babies/kids on board they still insisted on putting the cabin lights on when a lot of people were asleep to do another trolley run. I understand there is a business need but a bit of common sense wouldn't go amiss. Legroom wasn't too bad given that I am 6'4"". I just wish the cost of flights to Sharm would be a bit more reasonable with Easyjet especially when flights to Dubai are so much less with other airlines.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Travelled with hand luggage only. Both flights were full still the boarding was smooth and effective. Allocated seating was good as there is no rush experienced with other low costers did not pay extra to get the option to choose the seats yourself but it would be great if they offered at least a few seats per flight to choose from without extra charge like regular carriers.

When we got to the airport we were forced to pay £25 for luggage being 1 kg over weight. If that was British airways that would be fine. For the flight you have to pay for food which the prices are ridiculous and the food isn't that amazing. 1 year prior to this occasion my kids and I had to fly to Spain and unfortunately Easyjet messed up our booking and we had to miss a weeding! My advice is only go on Easyjet for a weekend out with your friends other than that better fly on British Airways or another airline.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I paid extra to pick my seat. There was a biting cold wind with gusts to 50mph. Boarding was really slow so I got to stand around on open steps for several minutes whilst people got their stuff packed. When I got on board my carefully chosen window seat turned out to be next to a screaming baby. I swapped with one of the parents so I was then one row away from a screaming baby. On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat. However with Easyjet if I am queuing outside I want everyone onboard and seated as soon as possible. When I've got a choice I will use some other airline.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The price was fantastic at least £20 cheaper than British Airways (on an equivalent flight). In general a good experience. don't expect them to be on time or to be as good as the more pricier companies but for a short flight (anything less than 3 hours) you really can't go wrong.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

On time on all 4 flights no problems with the flight. The problem is the airports. At Malaga we were sent down the ramp and then had to wait about 10 minutes while the previous passengers disembarked. We were right behind large glass panels and the sun was baking! No way to shelter. At LGW Easyjet has a sort of add-on terminal which is at least 400 yards along endless corridors from the exit into the main terminal. It carries the numbers from 100 upward and most North Terminal Easyjet flights use it. For anyone who finds walking less than pleasant it is a long way!","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Except during ash clouds and extreme weather the flights were punctual. Pity about the extra charge for credit card payment. Only train tickets to London via first capitol connect for sale in the plane pity as people are not aware that if they get in the wrong train they will have to pay again. Also other destinations eg Bedford not for sale in cabin. A shuttlebus to the railway station don't forget to buy your ticket for this in advance! Only plane tickets bought far in advance can be had for a reasonable price at the last minute very expensive. However this is a good airline if you are travelling to the Luton area London or using the railway service from Parkway.

Comfortable flight on a fairly new Airbus 320. Paid extra for exit row seats as this was a 4 hour flight and that gave us the option of Speedy Boarding. However not so important now that easyJet have started offering pre-assigned seats which removes the scrum. Speedy Boarding does mean you can drop your bag at a special Speedy Boarding desk rather than queue with the majority of passengers. This saved quite a bit of time at both ends. We had checked in online and the airline's website suggests you just turn up and drop your hold baggage. However Easy Jet's definition of ""bag drop"" sees the same lengthy queues at desks that you would get if you were checking in at the airport. Seats were comfortable with the extra legroom that goes with exit seats. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food offering is perfectly adequate for the length of journey. Plenty of information from the flight crew. Bit too much use of the PA system by the cabin crew. Altogether I find easyJet perfectly adequate for short haul flights.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I booked the premium flex ticket to get good leg room. I was advised that this type of ticket allowed me to change my flight date at an extra charge. I needed to change my flight date more than a month before flight date. I tried for days to access my booking on Airasia homepage and when the page finally allowed me to login (I had correct login credentials, the page just didnt work for days) it said I had no booking. Finally I had to call their customer service to have the flight changed instead. At customer support I explained that I needed to change my flight and was told that I had to sit on a standard seat. I asked if it could be solved. They didnt even try to have it sold but just said no. I end up with normal seat instead. I then asked for a refund since I was no longer getting what I paid for. Instead I was asked to pay 1500HKD extra for the change of the flight. I had known about this rule before, but I still asked for compensation due to not getting what I paid for. Also I later found out that if I had booked a new ticket instead of using my return ticket the cost of the new ticket would have been 1700HKD. That is 200HKD more than the fee I had to pay for changing my return ticket, but still several hundred HKD less than what I paid in upgrade for the premium flex ticket I had originally purchased.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

My flight supposed to depart at 03.10pm, on 31 March. They allowed passengers to check in at 11.00 am but didn't inform them about the delay. Once the immigration process was completed, then they changed departure time to 07.00pm. Now passengers don't have any option other than waiting. There wasn't any AirAsia executive present at the gate. We also didn't get any vegetarian food at Bali Airport. The airline provided food as it was delayed, but they ordered Non-Vegetarian food only. They should have some common sense that Non-Vegetarian people can eat Vegetarian food, but Vegetarian people cannot eat Non-Vegetarian food. Most of the co passengers were absolutely frustrated. They promised us that they would provide Vegetarian food on the flight. But when flight departed they told us that you have to buy it. I really will not recommend this AirAsia to anyone. While going to Bali from Mumbai, one flight attendant told me that currency exchange rate with AirAsia is different. Generally 1 INR = 210 IDR(app). But with Air Asia, 1 INR = 100 IDR. That was so pathetic. I wanted to choose twin seats while web checkin. The Customer support misguided me. They told me there wasn't any twin seats available in flight so I ended up booking different seats paying equal amount. And actually twin seats were there. This airline is bearable for those whose height is less than 165 Centimeters and a journey of max 3 hours. I will not travel via Air Asia again even if they provide me free tickets. I will not target the inflight entertainment and seating comfort as it is a low cost carrier. We should not expect more from it. It is just a plane which have seats with little cushion onto it. It take off from source and lands at destination. That's all.

My flight supposed to arrive at 23:45, on 31 march they changed it to 12:55am on 1 April and offer a chance to change my flight time within the same date. So I called the customer support and moved it to 10:45am, which took me almost 45 minutes to finish the phone call. It wouldn't bother me until they told me my flight would delay to 14:35 on 30 March. I called to confirm and they told my flight was still the same time. As soon as I arrived KUL airport, I found my flight delayed to 14:35, then I asked them to move my flight to the 12:00 one, they refused my ask cause I didn't change it 48 hours ago according their policy. They changed my flight within 48 hours and ask me to make a change before 48 hours?! The woman in the counter was unwilling to face the sentences stated in the email that If the new flight is inconvenient to you, please contact our Customer Support for either one of the following options: 1. Change your flight to another time/date within 14 calendar days from the original departure date or rquest for a credit account of the value of your booking which is to be redeemed within 90 calendar days from the issuance date for your future travel with us or equest for a full refund of the value of your booking. She said she can call her supervisor but the answer would still be the same. After the call, she said although my supervisor still not agree, I can change your flight. So booking airasia can save a little money but waste time.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5592-50x50.png","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5592-500x500.png","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5592-500x500.png","","Type Of Traveller

First time reviewer. The plethora of reviews surrounding this airline do not lie. To save time, let me first list the positives of my flights and then the problem areas. Positives: No delays. Flight arrivals were timely. Unloading was fast. Wifi was available for free. Problems: No staff acknowledgement getting on the plane to any passengers. Did not have Malaysian currency (coming from Vietnam) and was not allowed to pay by credit card so that I could have a bottle of water! Cue tip in the seat pocket from previous flight. Decor is most budget I have seen, carpet does not cover the whole floor of the plane and the stains/tears in the leather seating is obvious. Staff (not all) lacked a positive attitude toward the passengers. The rest is what you would expect from a budget airline i.e. tight, uncomfortable seating, no in-flight entertainment, no complimentary food/beverages, complimentary wifi was limited, no power supply, etc. This is a classic point A to point B service, which was delivered. However, there is budget flying and then there is Air Asia budget flying. Do not recommend.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I arrived at check in 3 hours before the flight and proceeded to check in. At check in my wife was questioned as she was traveling on a Russian passport and even though we live in Singapore and provided evidence the staff still had a long discussion in Malay about whether to check her in. Eventually they did and they gave us our boarding passes. I asked if we were all sat together and the check in agent clearly said yes. It wasn't until we got to immigration and i was asked to show our boarding passes when i saw they had my 2 year old daughter sat in a different row to my wife and I. This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels. The staff were not helpful at all in Singapore, it was only when i got onto the plane and spoke to the cabin crew did we find staff who were helpful and then helped us sort out seats together. On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together. I dont understand why Air Asia cause families problems at check in when they can clearly accommodate seats together. Why add extra anxiety and why cause cabin crew or gate staff more problems because the check in staff cant be bothered to help customers? Low cost airlines splitting up families so they can earn extra revenue is being investigated in the UK and the US Senate has stopped airlines splitting families.","Trip Verified","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

The staff on-board was very kind and helpful. The legroom was quite short for me, but as the flight took only one hour, it was easily bearable.

We paid extra for the Premium Flex package. To start things off, we thought the flight would depart from the International terminal at Don Muang airport. The only thing departing there was the long bus ride from the far northern end of the airport to the extreme southern end where the plane was parked. A few meters more and we would have boarded from Ram Intra Rd. The plane then taxied back to the far north for take-off. Why couldn’t a concourse gate be used? While inflight we expected to get our pre-ordered meals which were ordered when the flights were booked in April. No way. Instead we were given a bland rice dish instead with no explanation as to why and a small bottle of water. On arrival in Male our express handling of baggage was anything but. I counted nearly 40 bags of normal baggage before our luggage appeared on the belt. So much for “express handling”. The departure from Male on 178 was delayed by the late arrival of 177 from BKK. Why a turnaround flight originating in BKK should be late (first and only flight) is beyond comprehension unless it was mechanical, but then no explanation for the delay was ever given to the passengers. It finally departed for BKK 1 ½ hours late (14.05 vs 12.35). In addition, there was no priority seating except that we were able to get on the bus first followed by remaining passengers on the flight until the bus was full. And again we were given the same rice dish we got on the outbound flight. This time we argued with the attendants about failure to provide what was ordered. One of them had the guts to tell us that ""This is what you ordered"". I told her it was not what we ordered and that Air Asia thinks it can serve premium customers whatever it (Air Asia) wants. Cash customers got what they ordered. We refused to eat that rice and my wife had to pay to get a drink and a candy bar to eat and drink. My wife overheard 2 attendants saying that at least 10 pre-ordered meals were not provided to people on that flight. Arrival in BKK again put us in a closed down section of the airport (old domestic terminal parking bays) and again bussed to the northern end of the airport. Again, no priority – everyone (136 passengers) were crammed into one bus at the top the terminal. So I ask you, would you put up with this type of service when paying premium fares for so-called better service?","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

AirAsia are cheap, but that's all they have going for them. The experience I have with them is as follows: Deceptive - they add lots of charges and it's hard to navigate their online system to avoid the extra fees. Website crashes - as said above, their site is 'tricky' to navigate. I think it's deliberate, to trick you into buying extras you don't want and to gain revenue from inadvertent double bookings of flights. Customer service - there is none of this at AirAsia. None. Ziltch. I asked for help and they arrogantly didn't listen, instead just threw 'policy' or 'rules' at me. There is no compassion, no fairness, nothing. Just everything their way. They won't even provide an escalation process if unhappy with their ruling. Unfair and unjust. Small seating - the seats are too small for taller people. I hate that. I will never book an Air Asia ticket again.

With this flight we had 6 hours in Kuala Lumpur to catch the other flight. After a month I a got a message of a reschedule for about two hours later. It still should be enough for the transfer in Kuala Lumpur. On the day of departure when we arrived at the ariport a next reschedule of the flight. This means about two hours for transer. This is very tight for a transer in Kuala Lumpur, due to the two different terminals. We informed the AirAsia staff, they arranged a Priority luggage handling. The man took a picture of our passport and ticket and send it to Kuala Lumpur to inform the office there and probably inform the Oman Air counter, our connecting carrier. Finally, at the gate we waited for three hours to found out that the flight was delayd for almost an hour! The plane had a fast and smooth trip to Kuala Lumpur. At arrival we ran to the luggage band, picked up our luggage as first and run to the next terminal. At the second terminal we found out that the connecting flight of Oman-Air has left already. The result was that I had to buy 4 new tickets to Amsterdam. Back home filling in the e-form and ask for help or compensation. But the only response of Air Asia, sorry we are not responsible. We can not be charged for costs due to delay or rescheduling. This means that you cannot trust AirAsia if you have a connecting flight. If you cannot trust the schedule you better don't fly with AirAsia. Im sorry because the flight and onboard service is okay. The lesson is that a cheap ticket can turn to be very expensive.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I only had a cabin size suitcase, and a drawstring backpack with me. I have been travelling with AirAsia many times in the past, due to the it's competitive price, even though the seats are uncomfortable, but I don't mind it for short hauls. I have always been using the same cabin size suitcase when travelling with them. So size wise, I know my suitcase is definitely fine. For my drawstring backpack, anyone who has one knows you can't really put much in it. I only had my personal documents in the bag, plus a jacket to use while on the flight. After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time! He said I had to check in my suitcase. So I had to quickly rearrange things in my suitcase again! After all this messing around, my suitcase was finally ready for checking it, and I was charged IDR 800k for that! My flight was only IDR 1,380,400! I could have pay a little bit more, and flew with Cathay, which comes with 20kg check-in luggage, a much comfier journey with entertainment, plus direct flight. What really annoyed me was that after I went to the other side at the boarding gate, I saw so many people with over-sized luggage. I spoke to 2 staff there to make a complaint, but they ignored me. As soon as I landed, I sent an email to AirAsia to make this complaint, there were a lot of emails back and forth, but they were not willing to do anything about it. I'm fine if they want to follow their rules strictly, but please make sure it's consistent.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The check in was fair, but I asked to pay the baggage fee - I didn't know that the ticket fare I bought online was not covering baggage. The airport boarding room in Bandung was not too big, some passengers were standing. The flight delayed for 30 minutes. The ground staff didn't arrange the queue according to the seat area, so people started to queque 30 minutes before call. I was not aware about pre meal order and decided not to order on board. The seat space was enough for me, maybe near emergency exit was wider. For low cost flight, I think I would recommend AirAsia.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I had four AirAsia flights in the last week for my trip to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang and back to Changsha) three of which were delayed. The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined. Many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable. I would rather pay for a more expensive flight than take AirAsia again.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

There was an unintelligible announcement that was later claimed by the airline as last minute check-in announcement. I was denied check-in more than 45 minutes before the flight time, when the boarding pass clearly said that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure time, for a delay caused by the airline's poor line management. I was not offered the option to pay a chhange fee. Instead, I had to pay the price difference for a same day flight, which was between as much as I had paid for the whole trip, up to double that.

I have to say this was the worst travel experience I have had. We bought our fares through an online booking service rather than the airline. On the way there it was bought as one package i.e. one flight to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur then connecting flight to Ho Chi Minh City and we also bought a package of 2 flights for the way back the exact same way online. When arriving at Sydney no problem for the airline staff to print us both boarding passes for the Kuala Lumpur flight and also the Ho Chi Minh City flight at the same time. On the way back different story. They said that these were two separate flight bookings that our online booking service had made for us. So in KL we then had to go through all their security and customs and then check our bags again and this took us about 1.5 hours. Many times I have brought my own decaf coffee with me on the plane as airlines never serve decaf coffee and I don't drink caffeine. I usually just ask them if I can have a cup of boiling water with some milk and I add my own decaf coffee. I got told by a very nice air hostess that she would give me the hot water and milk (powdered) for free and that if I asked on another flight for this that I might be told to pay for a drink. There is no in flight entertainment and meals are not free as a low-cost airline. When you pay for a meal on the plane you must pay in Malaysian currency or credit card. Then if you don't have credit card you can't purchase anything. Fortunately I had some US dollars in cash and they made a quick conversion and I paid in that for my items.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money. On the pass they only give you useless 'credits' which you will never use in the limited time period.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Unfortunately it is difficult to rely on any flight time as they have started consolidating flights to fill planes. My booking for the earliest flight was to allow time to take my daughter to Singapore for her 21st birthday. First flight in, last flight out would give us 12 hours in singapore. 2 days before the flight to Singapore AirAsia resheduled it, ok fair enough, it was only by 2 hours. But then 6 hours before the flight they rescheduled it again by 3 hours. Then to add insult to injury the rescheduled flight was also delayed by 50 minutes. We finally got to Singapore but our entire whole day shopping trip turned into only 3 hours. Why offer such an extensive array of flights you have no intention to fulfil?

AirAsia has to be one of the all around worst airlines I have ever flown. I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care. They are so big, it will be hard to avoid them in the future, but I'll will do my best to use other airlines.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I tried to call and after a wait of over 100 minutes, the call was answered. I was cut off by their agent. Infuriating and an absolute disgrace and contempt for their passenger. A wait of this length says it all about their attitude. Wait long enough so you hang up? The problem then goes away? I emailed 6 weeks ago and am still waiting for a reply. I had to book again and lose the first flight for both of us. Why do AirAsia not allow minor changes within a set time, say 12/24 hours?

The leg space was so little, that my partner got cramps in his legs (he is nearly 2 meters) and even I (1.65m) was struggling being comfortable. Beside the lack of space, the staff were unfriendly, rude and didn't seem to be interested in their job at all. There was no onboard-entertainement and the check-in at Sydney Airport took nearly 2 hours. Yes, that is correct, we stood 2 hours in line to check in. Another reason why we would not choose AirAsia again is because of the fact that they left the lights on till 1am in the morning, while most people were trying to sleep. This broke us up, as we were so tired but couldn't sleep because of the lights. All in all, we wouldn't fly AirAsia anymore and strongly recommend to show up a few hours before your flight leaves, as the ground-staff were very slow. We had similair problems, a month later when we flew from Yangon to Bangkok: the airplane was a bit late and not cleaned at all. We were boarding the aircraft while the previous passangers hadn't even left the plane! Secondly, because of the lack of legspace, it will most likely be a very uncomfortable flight.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The check in was quite long and the ground staff not fast to handle. The flight initially was on time, but by the time we were onboard the aircraft, the pilots said that the air conditioner was not working and we need to wait for another 30 minutes. The flight in the end was delayed by around 1 hour. The cabin crews did not greet the passengers and involved in their own conversations. The food that I ordered was quite nice, which is nasi lemak. Overall, the flight was quite disappointing as the flight was delayed and the cabin crew not that friendly. It was worse than my previous AirAsia flights.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

Most ridiculous flight I've ever experienced. Flying with two adults, an infant on lap and a two year old child. At airport early and possible to check baggage through to final destination, but couldn't print boarding cards or check in for second leg of flight. At transfer desk as soon as landed and five plus hours before second flight but still given three seats each several rows apart - including our two year old. Told that this was within policy since we had not paid extra to reserve seats together and there was nothing they could do but we could ask at the gate. Did that and told nothing they could do but should ask on board. On board told no, that was the policy and we couldn't change seats. Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries. Eventually simply picked two random empty seats next to each other and pleaded with passengers to swap who thankfully took pity on us. Will not be flying Air Asia again, am amazed that their policy of two year olds sitting on their own is even legal.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Some days afterwards I received an e-mail from AirAsia saying the flight from Denpasar / KL was rescheduled leaving me 10 minutes between flights. There were 2 links: One for a telephone number which I called and whose lady said she couldn't help. Another for a chat that was consistently unavailable for 2 days. Also a e-form, which I used twice, but with no answer. The email itself couldn't be answered. After several tries on at least two days and two hours (in total) waiting, I managed to contact the live chat. I found out they would keep my money at least one month, if I'd cancel and ask for a refund. I had to search for alternative flights myself,on AirAsia website while chatting - they didn't help on any regard. In between, the chat was timed-out. So I had to wait again and managed to change the flight to the only option that allowed me to arrive on time at Manila. That forced me to stay overnight at KL.

I don't normally use low cost airlines and this was only my fourth flight on a low cost and I fly at least 12 times each year. All previous flights where on AirAsia and only pretty short so I was a bit scepticle using them for this 4h+ flight. The direct options between Bali and Bangkok are limited to either Thai or AirAsia from what I can see, the AirAsia schedule suited me better so I choose the full package including luggage, Red Carpet Service, preferred seat, food and comfort kit. Check in was quick using the red carpet service which was also fully escorted from check in through security to the lounge. The lounge is old but so is the airport but fine to spend an hour with food and wifi. Boarding through gate 6a was done with priority and included a bus ride on my own as part of the red carpet service. Once onboard seat 1A was fine with enough space, not the most comfortable seat but okay. Crew where young but polite the food was also okay for airline food. Take off right on time with a flight time a little longer at 4h20m so landed a little late. Bags took a little time to arrive once off the flight at DMK. Otherwise a great flight and great service from the ground crew at DPS all for less than £100 which was half the cost of the nearest indirect option with the other direct option costing 3 times more.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I previously had no major problem. However, this time I felt really disappointed with their punctuality. The round trip Jakarta to Singapore, each trip was delayed 45 min to 1 hour. In addition of that, before take off and landing, the crew told the passengers that due to traffic on the airport, the aircraft had to wait for another 15 to 30 min. For me, that just could not be more annoying. AirAsia is no longer a budget flight. The price has gone up tremendously. It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays. With competitors now offering better options and coming up with new promotions, I think AirAsia may start losing its grip. Check-in now has to be self-service and the early passengers can't choose their seats. It is now randomly assigned. Distance between rows is really narrow.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

The plane is pushed back for take off and then returns to stand with captain saying there are technical issues. We get off back into terminal and wait for +2 hours before reboarding plane. Whilst in terminal no offer of water or food - in fact passengers that bought water were told they were unable to take back with them onto aircraft. If you wanted water you had to buy. Eventually take off and get to Perth before landing and then waiting for further 30 minutes in aircraft with engines running as ""no ground crew to assist"" and lighting in plane left off so we disembark in the dark. Total of 11 hours for return trip to Perth and ruined what was a great first time trip to Bali. Have never used a budget airline before and will not be doing again. Indonesia AirAsia do not look after customers when there are problems.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

I have no qualms with Air Asia flight. What I want to point out is whether Air Asia's website can be more user-friendly. For example, there is no ""manage my flight"" in the website, Web-check in was another headache. It was so difficult to do so as the website cannot find my flight despite keying in the booking reference number and correct full name! One has to sign in and view one's bookings in order to access the flight. Having succeeded in going to the web-check in page, I had to key in five passengers passports numbers and other details, But lo and behold when all done, I was told session timed out and everything I keyed in was gone. There was no warning whatsoever. I hope my experience is an isolated one. If not, Air Asia management needs to look in to this.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Tremendous online website, especially for mobile devices. Booking and paying for a flight has never been more easy. Two days before the flight I received a reminder email including flight and departure/arrival terminal details plus a direct link to the online check in website . Save/print or screenshot the email and thats really all you need. According to the email the departure terminal was number 3, in reality it was terminal 2F. The difference is a 30.000IDR taxi drive that can take up to 30 minutes. This can make the difference between making it in time or being late. Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient. All the check in desks could be used for all Air Asia flights. Boarding was done by a bus that brought us to an aerobridge which seems an odd thing to do but ok, it works. Boarding was a little late, as was the push back of the aircraft. Jakarta can be a very busy airport but this was not the case for this specific flight. Total delay before take off was about twenty minutes. The aircraft cabin had a pleasant cold temperature and the boarding process was relatively quick, although the aircraft was not full. The aircraft itself felt it needed a big cabin overhaul. Carpet was dirty and the safety card / inflight magazines were sticky and dirty. As we all know, this is a low cost carrier and we all enjoy the low fares. Air Asia's main focus is delivering value for money. But, is it necessary to have a pink, brown and greenish advertisement for a coffee company all over the overhead luggage bins? Service onboard was friendly and all crew spoke good English. I even got a free sandwich and a glass of water as it was included in my added cargo baggage package. In terms of service it is all you want and need from a low cost carrier and more.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","","","","","","Aircraft

The airline is moving towards gouging their guests for every penny and placing restrictions which encourage you to buy on-board. I am appalled at their current policy of no outside food or drink on board. In terms of the flight, punctual, clean planes, professional crew. The cabin temperature on KUL - DPS leg was arctic like and almost tropical on the DPS - KUL leg. Legroom is non existent and woe betide you get a kid behind you or a sleepy recliner in front.

KLIA is a very large airport and I was unable to make the cut off in that short duration to board the connecting flight. AirAsia took that as a no-show and made me pay 74 Singapore dollars as a ""change fee"" to board the next available connecting flight. Terrible on the part of Air Asia for doing this.

Flight was retimed to 2hrs later and the airline informed me less than 24hours before, which was too late to make other arrangements. I tried contacting the airline via live chat and twitter as they don't have a call centre. After hours trying to reach the live chat agent, I was told they could not do anything for me. Then I contacted them via Twitter and they informed me that I can opt for an earlier flight which was 2hrs earlier than my flight and I have to be put on standby at the airport, without any guarantee that I can fly then. I end up flying at 2050hrs instead of the original 1835hrs departure. Arrived at the airport and checked in. The agent informed me that they will compensate the delay by providing meals which was just average. Boarding was quick. The flight was parked at a remote stand, and were transported by a bus. Once onboard, the crew apologised for the delay many times and we very polite. The sale of inflight meals and snacks was done professionally with a wide range of hot meals and snacks at affordable prices. The flight was uneventful and before arrival, the crew bowed and thanked us for flying with them.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

Their scales at KBV registered 5kgs more than the scales at DMG. Seat pitch bad which resulted in bruised knees when the pax in front recline his seat hard. Stewardess stated he had a right to do so but did not how I was feeling. Safety onboard poor with no one seated at the emergency exits as thes are added value seats. Money before safety.

Flight departed slightly behind schedule, the captain made an apology on the delay before the aircraft taxied off. Cabin crew were Sabah based crew. Inflight meal was served soon after the seat belt sign is off and passengers with pre-booked meal are on the priority. Majority of the passengers are originated from mainland China. Cabin crew are patient to answer and assist passengers despite the language barrier. I am impressed with the hospitality and service.

Upon boarding, I found out that all crew were non Chinese speaking despite the large number of passengers from China. A big disappointment was that the crew made the safety announcement in Malay. Based on my observation, the crew had communication problems in assisting and handling the requests from passengers from the moment of boarding to arriving at our destination. I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation. In my previous flight, one of the cabin crew had no choice but to turn to me to assist her to communicate with the passengers.","Verified Review","http://www.airlinequality.com/verified-reviews/","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSC06809ar-50x50.jpg","","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSC06809ar-500x500.jpg","http://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSC06809ar-500x500.jpg","","Aircraft

Get to connecting gate on time and there's no staff there to unlock the waiting area so people are sitting in the corridor on the floor waiting 20 minutes for staff to show up. Staff finally show up and the wait begins. People are expecting to board but we wait. After about 15 minutes I walk up to the gate desk and confirm that the flight is delayed. About ten minutes after this, someone at the desk gets the bright idea of actually proactively communicating this info to the rest of the passengers over the PA. We are given a boarding time of 7:25PM. I leave and come back at 7:20 and we're still not boarding 10 minutes later. I ask again if the flight is going to be further delayed and I am told that 7:45 is the new time. I began to watch the customer service performance of the lady working the desk and I become amazed at how much basic training in customer service the staff are lacking. She gives no information until people come up and ask what time the flight is leaving. People wouldn't have been getting upset had they just had this basic info communicated to them. This way, people can make arrangements for their pickups from the airport, arrange a late check in etc. Pretty basic stuff. All told, this lady allowed 12 people to get so ticked off that they came up and angrily asked what was going on. She gave them all the same reply she gave to me, but it blew my mind that she never once picked up the PA and told everyone. She wasn't doing anything else really. All told the plane landed in Penang an hour late - not a huge deal but the manner in which this delay was handled was amateur.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Quite a full flight. I'd checked in online and it was a breeze through the baggage drop as most passengers seemed to have decided to check in old skool style. Plane was loaded efficiently and departed on time. With a favourable tail wind and lack of air traffic, we arrived in KUL half an hour early. Unfortunately there was a plane in our parking slot which hadn't departed yet, so lost 15 mins. The seat on the plane was pretty standard Air Asia legroom and recline - not a great deal. But given the attractive price of my ticket, I'd say it was pretty good value for money. Couldn't really comment on the inflight service as I was asleep for the most part or playing games on my phone. As we seem to have been the first flight of the day arriving, some of the entry doors in the KLIA2 terminal were not opened, further eroding the gains from the early arrival. Quick through immigration and a long wait for baggage to be unloaded - this took about an hour. Also, quick through Customs checks. All in all, a great value product for a short flight where luxuries are not required.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

However, their Premium Flex ticket provides many other advantages that I’m willing to pay more for. Extra luggage, express boarding, dedicated counter for check-in, an inflight meal, etc. For such short flights, which have become so commoditized, I like having choices that are clearly outlined and well priced. Plus the biggest benefit is that when you pay extra for a hot seat, I nearly always have the whole row to myself.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The Bangkok segment was a disaster. I booked online and paid for reserved seats (both ways for 2 people) and meals. When we went to the airport the flight representative said that we had to pay for seats to sit together. I explained that I had already done that but she said that I was not in the system. So I had to pay for seats again (and then were still not together). The flight itself was equally poor. Absolutely no legroom and there was no audio or video program for the 4 hour flight. The meal was laughable, we could not work out what was in the bread. The Bali return was much better as the representative was attentive and helpful. He found that we did in fact pay for seats online and offered to put us in the exit row with extra legroom for a minimum cost which we gladly accepted.

The cabin crew are friendly, professional, helpful and provided an efficient services. Flight on time with no delayed. Onboard meals tasted delicious. Ground staff was good just a little bit slow but friendly. Would fly with this company again for future. Great company with great service on board. Well Done.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I've taken many of the budget airlines in Southeast Asia, but Air Asia remains my favorite. In fact, I think Air Asia may even be better than some of the full carriers in the area. I've flown Siem Reap to Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, Singapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai to Singapore, Jakarta to Yogyakarta, and the Singapore/Jakarta route several times. I never had any problems with any of my flights. None of my flights were ever delayed, which definitely can't be said for the other airlines I've taken around Southeast Asia. Their app also works well, but it's only available for use at certain airports. The ground staff is can sometimes seem a bit course, but they are efficient and get the job done. Don't expect a luxurious ride, this is a budget airline after all, and you get what you pay for. The air staff is very nice and courteous. I've purchased food from them, which I found to be tasty and reasonability priced considering it is a budget airline and you're in the sky. They also sell a variety of things on board, but I've never purchased one of them. There isn't much for entertainment besides the travel magazine, but I've only ever taken short flights with them, so it's easy to entertain yourself with a book or your own device. There is not a lot of leg space though, which is to be expected, but if you are a larger person, you might want to consider purchasing one of the priority seats instead. Overall, i recommend Air Asia whenever you're looking for basic service to get you where you have to go quickly and cheaply.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

We paid more the S$200 for a return air ticket for each of us. We were to fly on 31 December to KL and return on 3 Jan 2016 (peak season, off peak the ticket is less than S$50 each way). On 28 December 2015, Airasia wrote to us that our flight on 3 Jan 2016 was cancelled and rescheduled to fly on 5 Jan 2016. When I went online to check, there were agents selling tickets to return on 3 Jan 2106 on AirAsia but the tickets were nearly S$200 one way. I went into the Airasia website to have an online chat. Waited an hour before the operator repeated that the flight was cancelled but I told him there were other agents selling the ticket. He repeated the instructions of the email. I had also bought my hotel accommodations from Airasia and asked if I could cancel the entire trip. The operator could only cancel my flight and my hotel booking cannot be cancelled (my hotel cost more than the flight)! I asked what if I want to come back on the 3 Jan because my friend cannot apply for any leave. I was basically told that was my problem. Left without any real options, I requested a refund for my flights back from KL. My friend bought a new ticket from SQ returning on 2 Jan for less than S$100 and I return on 5 Jan for a ticket that was less than S$50. AirAsia gave us an option to fly back on the 5 Jan 2015 (the ticket cost less than S$50). I asked if I flew back on the 5 Jan 2015 with Airasia, would I receive a refund of the difference. The answer was no.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

After almost five hours of waiting, a fellow passenger called the airline directly and finally someone showed up at the gate. The ""so called"" AirAsia representative was pretty much worthless in terms of knowing when we would leave. The only way I found out was by visiting the global flight status website which had all correct and updated information!

When I told the clerk that I couldn't pay online, because I was told that this was my problem and I should have called the customer service. Don't pay for ""hot seats"" - that's another rip off. You get no extra legroom, but you do get extra 15 minutes in a stuffy cabin waiting for everyone else to board, because ""hot seats"" board first. If you want any food - prepay when you are checking in. Otherwise, you won't even get a glass of water out of them. Value for money - not so good. We paid $550 for 2 seats from Siem Reap to Phuket and then an extra $144 for the luggage, so this is not a low coster.

The flight was delayed by an hour on the way to Bangkok but this wasn't really a problem as it was an early morning flight so couldn't check in to my hotel anyways. We boarded the plane and it was clean and staff were welcoming. We arrived at Bangkok a little later then expected. On our return flight we ran into a few problems, upon arriving at the airport in Bangkok the flight was being showed as delayed and when we were checking in the staff informed that the flight was delayed due to a late departure from it origin airport. We sat in the terminal waiting for updates, one hour after we were supposed to depart we were allowed to board the plane and sat down in our allocated seats. The captain announced that the flight was going to be further delayed due to a faulty tire on the plane and it would take around 45-60 minutes to replace the tire. The captain kept us updated throughout the process, after roughly and hour we set off from Bangkok and were quickly in the skies. Thirty minutes into the flight I couldn't help but notice that the engine was making a very loud noise, it was a lot louder than usual. We circled the airport for around about thirty minutes when the captain announced we needed to re land at the airport due to engine problems. We landed back in Bangkok and were escorted to a terminal where we were told to await further instructions, we were given food vouchers while we had to wait and given the means to make calls. After a two hour wait we finally boarded and were on our way to Kuala Lumpur. We landed around five hours later than we were supposed to staff at the customer services were not very helpful and didn't really make and effort to understand passengers complaints.

As a result, I had to cancel all of my 3 flights back to the US, rebook my flight to Manila at 200% the rate that I originally paid, and then rebook all of my US flights. It was extremely inconvenient and AirAsia provided no leniency. I am fortunate have the finances to cover the extra charges, but it was a terrible experience to go through while on my one vacation for the year.

The afternoon I was leaving London to get to KUL I received a message advising the flight had been rescheduled to a 1405 departure time! (4hrs 15mins earlier). My flight from London was due to land at 1520 so there was no way I would make it. Because of the time change, I had to call AirAsia in Indonesia and explained the situation. There was a later flight (showing available online) departing at 2020 and asked to be moved on to that. Was put on hold for a long time to be advised they would have to charge me to do that and that I should try at KUL airport to change for free. Upon arrival in KL, the later flight was full and was advised I was rebooked at 1030 the next morning. Also flew DPS-KUL-LGK - had to wait 45 mins for bags to arrive in KL and check in again. Air Asia's online system wouldn't let me do KUL-DPS-KUL-LGK-KUL as 1 booking, so had to make separate bookings, and the handling agent in DPS couldn't thru check my luggage to LGK. DPS-KUL three passengers upgraded themselves to premium seats and the crew didn't move them back to their original seats. LGK-KUL crew didn't even leave the galley - no service at all - they blamed the turbulence, even when the Captain announced it was a smooth flight.

We live in the UK and have 1 holiday a year so this was of no use. We asked them for a refund but they refused despite the fact they could not transport us in a reasonable time.

KLIA Terminal 2 (LCC) is a bit of a let down, it's already showing 'cracks' and it's still very new. Processing through the airport is normally fast and efficient, the shops and restaurants are excellent but once airside the skyways, travelators etc. are poor, depending on which gate you're at the walk can be ridiculously long! Food on board if great value, and if you prebook choice is also excellent, better than some main stream national carriers I've used!","","","","","","","","Aircraft

The booking experience was fine. Had already registered on their website for a domestic flight earlier. While planning my trip researched on Internet and found out they had this sale where Tickets were priced less than half of Others. Without a second thought booked two for me and my wife. While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English. Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean. AirAsia X flight from KUL to MEL was a widebody jet. There was no entertainment system. Seats were tight for me (6 feet) but my wife (5/6) was alright. Had 7 and 5 hours lay over at KLIA terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur which is fine for Shopping and Eating and even has a low cost Samasama hotel where we rested for few hours. Overall I got what I paid for. I recommend planning and booking in advance to book in their frequent sales and making most of it.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

I don't normally use Low cost airlines however for short trips I find them fine. Web check in for both flights quick and easy I had no baggage so straight through security and immigration. Boarding done by row and I had seat 1A, flight left on time and arrived spot on time. Flight time of 45 min, seat comfortable and was given a water by the young nice crew. Return once again checked in on the web so straight through the efficient Changi immigration and security to gate D37. Boarding fairly orderly although done by row number and again 1A. Flight departed on time but due to poor weather took a little longer, around 1hr 10min. The crew were unable to serve anything due to the turbulence but otherwise flight was fine. If using this airline, pay a little more for a hot seat, it's worth the few ££. This return trip cost me almost 100% less than the others on this route.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

On the way over we flew an overnight flight. It was the coldest flight I have been on. Even with boots, jumper, scarf and our own blanket we were cold. When we arrived at the Gold Coast, the outside air temperature was 16 degrees - that felt warm. Moreover the lights were left on until very late (approx. 2.5 hrs after take off) and turned on very early (approx. 3 hrs before landing). We had very little time for sleeping. In conclusion, it was the most uncomfortable flight we have traveled on. On the return trip, we were notified via email around 3.40 am that the flight was about 3 hour delayed, however we left home at 5am and had not checked our email so we were not aware of the delay. When we arrived at the airport we tried to ask staff to issue us a Boarding pass for the next available connecting flight to Bangkok from KL as we knew we would miss our originally booked flight. However we were told they could not do that but she assured us that Air Asia staff in KL would be able to get us a flight to Bangkok that evening. When we arrived at KL we (and other passengers who missed their connecting flights) were made to wait at the transit desk for around 40 mins before we were notified that all of us had to stay overnight in KL and fly the next day. In the end we gave up realising that nothing could be done, we had no other choice but to fly the following morning. It was about 3 hours before we could leave the airport with other passengers.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

I'm 6 foot tall, and I usually go in a window seat and I am fine. I was on the aisle seat for both flights and found my legs crammed in. My seat wouldn't recline and found it impossible to find a comfortable position. The plane was too cold, I shivered on the plane and can only be grateful I wasn't allocated a middle or window seat. If you are over 6 feet, 183cm tall, don't expect a pleasant experience. Only good thing was the staff were absolutely fine.","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

Beforehand, I read some reviews about AirAsia online and 99% of them were really bad. Everyone was complaining about delayed/changed flights and poor customer service. After all I read, I expected awful flights but in fact everything went smoothly. All flights were on time (except one - 2 hours delay) and customer service was good. And yes, you have to pay for drinks and food on board but come on, I got 5 flights around Asia for less than £200 altogether. I would fly with AirAsia again!","","","","","","","","Type Of Traveller

We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters. AirAsia is cheap as chips and very efficient - what's not to like on this easy 3.5 hour run between Perth and Bali.","","","","","","","","Aircraft

One of the worst experiences I have had. We boarded the flight which was scheduled to depart at 5.25 pm but due to some technical reasons they returned from the runway and had to change the plane at the last moment. As a result the flight got delayed by almost 3 hours. Next surprise was that they did not offer complementary food considering everybody was just sitting in the plane for 3 hours. When some of us asked the reply was that they are not carrying sufficient food for everyone. The crew was inexperienced. They had no idea about how to handle the situation. I think Air Asia should focus on the quality of services before expanding their network.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Planes were clean and new and seats were comfortable but small. I paid extra to book the first row and there was plenty of legroom. The first five rows are reserved for anyone who buys the premium seats (I think it cost about 10 bucks) and they were mostly empty on both flights so I was able to lay down and sleep across the second row. I pre-booked a meal for a few dollars and it was pretty good. Only complaint is they bus you to the plane from the terminal so boarding is a bit hectic. Overall great experience for a budget airline.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I generally found them to be a value airline but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare ""all in"" is an advertising pitch leaving you to find it.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Not too sure about the male crew as I only saw them sitting down or eating as their female colleagues worked. The Business Class seats were very comfortable and a pillow and duvet was provided. Food was warm and served at the time you requested. Ground crew in KL kept customers waiting for more than 20 mins as they served 1 customer with issues. Common sense would dictate that this customer be served separately and kept the line moving. Staff were very strict with luggage allowance as I saw many people re-packing at the counters.

They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering. Never again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times.

To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all my experiences were certainly negative ones.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

First time on Air Asia. A320 arrived late but plane was turned around quicker than normal. Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced. Luggage was off quickly - immigration took forever but that isn't Air Asia's fault.

Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing. Think its a standard of Air Asia to not announce delays promptly. Flight was good - 2 hours and again a seat in the middle free. Bought noodles and snacks - good value for money and delicious. Landed at KUL Terminal 2 about 45 minutes late and bags came out fairly quickly. Enjoyed the flight and definitely a good fare.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude. A few ground staff at the old LCCT had a poor command of English. On balance though in my 8 years of flying on AA and AAX I have found AA and AAX to be good to excellent.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future.

This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights.

We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer. As far as value for money goes I could not have wished for a better experience. We will certainly use this airline again where possible.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class.

AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore.

Having flown dozens of times in SE Asia and might we add that we always fly Business Class for our long haul with another airline we find Air Asia short flights excellent. If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual good value food wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating. As with Ryanair follow their rules and you will have no problems.","","","","","","","","Seat Comfort

I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given boarding spoken in English seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights FA's were well presented with good command of English flights all left on time food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short.

Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay but the general feel is of a barebone service.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage. It is not that exclusive anyway economy class passenger can just walk pass you anytime anyhow.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'. Service recover for whom? Formerly loyal Air Asia customers. No longer.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

At check in at Changi this was confirmed and my dad was well taken care of right up till he was seated. Cabin crew professional organised and polite. Seat comfort was ok legroom is tight but that was expected. Departure and arrival were both almost 40 mins late. Wheelchair was waiting after deplaning via stairs at Bali. (I did wonder how we would have managed getting my dad down had he not been able to use the stairs..) Fortunately he did and he was met by a friendly ground staff who took him all the way through. Bags were out quickly. Return from bali was equally efficiently handled. No problems with the wheel chair request and early boarding. All in all very impressed with Air Asia's professionalism and well run operation.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The four members of staff at boarding gate were either sleeping or playing with their phones. None took any interest in the customers despite the flight boarding time coming and going with no announcements. On the return flight 5 days later the cabin crew failed to notice 3 extremely drunk passengers who I guess were automatically allocated online emergency exit seats! When I told the cabin crew about this they asked them to move and one of the crew later thanks me. I sat in one of the emergency exit seats and was given no extra information which was unusual as every time prior when seated on such seats the staff took the trouble to make sure I was familiar with how to open the door in the very unlikely event of an emergency.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

This time 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that yes the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy but being late by that much without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA I thought that was extremely bad.

Air Asia charges extra for every possible option. I booked a ""hot seat"" which should have priority boarding. No priority was ever offered and I was stuck in a mad rush of people to get on the plane. I also pre-booked food. I saw the flight attendants bring food to several passengers around me but passed by me with the food cart. I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least. The bathroom was out of soap and when I again used the call button to get out of sight flight attendant's attention she explained that there had been many flight segments and that the soap had run out. No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap. After about 45 minutes the entire flight crew went to the back of the plane and closed the curtain while they read the newspaper and chatted. No one was in the front of the aircraft until landing. The floor of the plane had bits of trash all about. The worst flight I have ever been on.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

As stated by others on this site they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag) we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic!

The boarding thus became messy although we managed to get through because of our priority boarding seat privilege. On the return flight our group consisted of 13 persons with 4 booking codes. We were told to check-in as a group and we were the first group to check in at the counter. Our queue however was overtaken by another tour group. We had to ""protest"" in order to have our queue maintained. Check-in was slow and rather inefficient and we were informed that it is because the staff are new. BTW the inflight services are OK on both legs. Web-ordered meals were reasonable. Finally when we arrived at DMK three of our luggage had lost the luggage tags.

The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia.

I found the process of check-in well organized and tolerable. A low cost airline is going to have large crowds to manage and they did a good job. The seats are tight but no worse than more expensive airlines. Ads are tedious but I am sure these keep the cost down. All in all a satisfactory experience. They got us where we wanted to go efficiently and on schedule. Isn't that what a ""Now everybody can fly"" airline supposed to do?","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service.","","","","","","","","Seat Comfort

However the flight was smooth and seats were comfortable for a low cost carrier. A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate. The process itself took another 30 minutes. So overall we were delayed by over an hour.

KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays).

I regret flying with AA. Pre-ordered meals were of very poor quality. There was a only very limited selection of food available for purchase - only peanuts chocolates and fizzy drinks. The flight was freezing cold and I had to pay money to rent a basic blanket. No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude. The flight attendants speak little English. They are careless. I think what they sell as business class is probably as comfortable as Qantas Economy.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one. Everyone goes on a holiday to have a good time. Your holiday starts from the moment you are in the aircraft. Go for that little extra spending and choose a renowned airline.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown. The inflight service however is OK given its a totally discount airline with no frills whatsoever - you will pay for everything including water.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

KUL - PEN was delayed around 90 minutes with no announcement or board notice of when we would actually depart which was a little frustrating.

One is DMK-PHN and another one is DMK-HKT. Both are returned flight. Good move by Thai AirAsia for choosing DMK as their hub - less hassle and easy to get to. Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend. I flew with my fiancé so we did manage to get the seat we want by just talking your way through. Aircraft is a new A319 which was a complete step-up from their old B737 a couple years ago I flew with them. Nothing fancy about cabin crew as we did not use their service at all (not buying any food). I would definitely fly them again - just because of their competitive price compared to other airline such as Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes. I am not going to fly Air Asia again unless I have no other choice.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy.

Plane was a little late leaving Chiang Mai and due to ""congestion"" our plane landed at the international airport - presumably not carrying enough fuel to wait for a landing slot. Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food. Minimal breakfast in hotel but no lunch offered even though our substitute flight was 1.45pm. Low budget should not mean such rubbish service when the airline is at fault.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

If you are taller than 180cm there will be not be enough room for your legs. They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced. While boarding the crew insist on blasting cheesy rock music regardless of the time. The vegetarian food is over- priced for the small serving I received. The amount of money saved is minimal after adding up all of the extra costs.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee. I only used them as a friend arrived at DMK also with Air Asia. Price was almost same as Bangkok Airways to BKK and will continue to use them if flying to BKK and beyond.

Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money.

Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

These seats were the worst I'd ever been on without question. In our case the flight was a little over an hour and we had the row to ourselves to spread out. I would never book this airline for longer legs with more passengers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Outbound flight departed on time and on our return we actually departed a little early. Keeping in mind the low price we paid for tickets for a two and half hour flight Air Asia provided excellent value for money and we would certainly use them again.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I took the 10pm flight from KUL to PEN on 27th August (after a very good flight on AirAsia Premium from SYD). I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers. AirAsia is a real mess at LCCT. I have taken more than 50 AA flights including KUL PEN JHB SIN. KUL LCCT is shameful a disappointment to what is otherwise a great Low-Cost Airline.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Flights took off on time. Our pre-booked meals were hot and delicious. Service was good but seats were very uncomfortable as it had no proper back support. Online booking for KUL-BKI sector had us all in different seats so we had to pay again to sit together. LCCT needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The signboards and facilities are in dire need of improvement. Toilets are wet and slippery. The taxi coupon tickets are a blessing and I have discovered during our shopping trips in KL that the taxi drivers driving the red and white cabs will refuse to use the meters to charge more.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Service is awful. No direction whatsoever from the ground staff. Queue system was a disaster as there's no indication of which line to go to. The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle. My flight end up with 2 passengers to Johor and it took them 40 minutes to find that out.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that. We got excellent value for money because we booked these tickets about a year ahead at one of the sale promotions (Fare was US$ 45 return).","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Once you know how to 'play' low cost airlines they do offer good value for money (but not always). The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry. FA's need to be more strict (politely of course) with pax who get ready to get off long before the aircraft reaches the gate.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

We were pleasantly surprised how good this low cost airline is. Aircraft is pretty new neat and clean; crew friendly helpful and efficient. Check-in agents at both Singapore and KL were nice and efficient. Nothing was free onboard we bought bottle water and a sandwich. Prices were reasonable. The Low Cost Carrier Terminal took a bit to get used but we had no problem getting help with immigration customs and transportation to city proper.

Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight.

I wish the company would enforce their 'one carry-on bag' policy. Some passengers on one flight had up to four large bags.

Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure.

There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG.

Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine.

Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer.

I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around. Having done PR for major events including such new services I was sorely disappointed. Frankly Thai Ai Asia's product is far below that of its big brother in Malaysia and it shows.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Very nice journey nice crew and leather seats in airplane. Very easy to book. If you book place near window (right side) you will see nice view to Thai islands for example Ko Samui.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

My first experience of Thailand's division of Air Asia. Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new. If the price is right this is the way to go but they are not always the cheapest option especially to Hong Kong where competition is fierce with a multitude of third country carriers flying that route.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

Flight departed 15minutes early and arrived 25minutes early. seats comfortable legroom ok for a lo-cost carrier. baggage very quick on arrival. Return journey checked in at the desk very quick and efficient. Although flight was only 1/3 full we didn't get seated together and were put across the aisle from each other despite the two seats next to me where empty. Flight on time and arrived early baggage again very quick.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown

I bought the ticket on internet. The process was a bit time consuming as I had to click through many pages. The 48 hours web check in was very convenient as I could check in on both flights. But still I had to go to the check-in counter at the airport for document check. Check in at Bangkok was long. I only had a handbag and I was directed to a counter for that purpose. Service was good. I am 1.81 and found the seat spacing adequate. There was a wide variety of food options which could be ordered when the ticket was purchased. Cabin staff professional and friendly on both flights. My only complaint is that on the return flight a PRM (Person with Reduced Mobility) was seated between me and the aisle (I had a window seat). I don't think this is legal and it caused discomfort for the other person.","","","","","","","","Cabin Flown
